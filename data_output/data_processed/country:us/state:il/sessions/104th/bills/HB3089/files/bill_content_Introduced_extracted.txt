This Act may be referred to as the Community 6Disability Living Wage Act. 7    Section 2. Findings. 8        (1) An estimated 22,000 children and adults with 9    intellectual and developmental disabilities are supported 10    in community-based settings in Illinois; direct support 11    professionals (DSPs), are trained paraprofessional staff 12    who are engaged in activities of daily living and 13    community support; too many of these employees earn wages 14    that place them and their families below the poverty 15    level.16        (2) In Illinois, nearly half of direct care workers 17    rely on public assistance to make ends meet, creating 18    additional expenditures for State government; low wages 19    are a consequence of the historically low reimbursement 20    rates paid by the State of Illinois to community-based 21    service providers. 22        (3) The lack of adequate wages for employees who 23    perform the challenging work of supporting persons with   HB3089- 2 -LRB104 06905 KTG 16941 b1    intellectual and developmental disabilities results in 2    high employee turnover, which in turn negatively impacts 3    the quality of services provided, higher wages are proven 4    to reduce staff turnover, improving stability and quality 5    of services while reducing employer training costs.6        (4) Rising wages in other sectors now means, despite 7    modest wage increases and strenuous efforts to recruit new 8    workers, agencies are struggling to fill positions and 9    keep them filled with 90% of community providers 10    experiencing staffing challenges. Excessive vacancies 11    force employers to rely more on overtime, with providers 12    reporting an average of 11,000 hours of staff overtime a 13    month, leading to staff burnout and driving up costs.14        (5) A December 2020 report issued by an independent 15    consulting group commissioned by the State to propose 16    changes to the State's reimbursement for community 17    disability agencies recommended that addressing DSP wages 18    was the number one priority for ensuring compliance with 19    the mandates of the Ligas Consent Decree, and further 20    recommended that wages for DSPs should be fixed at 150% of 21    the prevailing minimum wage plus additional funding for 22    benefits.23        (6) The difference between 150% of the State minimum 24    wage on January 1, 2025 and the hourly DSP wage rate set by 25    the State amounts to $2.00 per hour.26        (7) The General Assembly finds that in order to reduce   HB3089- 3 -LRB104 06905 KTG 16941 b1    turnover, increase retention, fill vacancies, and ensure 2    DSPs are adequately compensated for the critically 3    important work they do, an increase in rates and 4    reimbursements to community-based service providers to 5    effectuate an increase in the hourly wage paid to DSPs is 6    needed. 7    Section 3. Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of this 8Act to increase the wages of DSPs and other front-line staff in 9community disability agencies beyond the poverty level and to 10a level competitive with rival employers and above the State 11minimum wage, in an effort to improve the lives of DSPs and the 12lives of the vulnerable persons they support. 13    It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that all 14funds resulting from rate increases provided to community 15disability agencies are allocated to front-line employee wages 16in order to address the current workforce crisis which is the 17primary obstacle to the availability of community-based 18services for people with disabilities. 19    Section 5. The Illinois Administrative Procedure Act is 20amended by adding Section 5-45.65 as follows: 21    (5 ILCS 100/5-45.65 new)22    Sec. 5-45.65.

This Act may be referred to as the Community 6Disability Living Wage Act. 7    Section 2. Findings. 8        (1) An estimated 22,000 children and adults with 9    intellectual and developmental disabilities are supported 10    in community-based settings in Illinois; direct support 11    professionals (DSPs), are trained paraprofessional staff 12    who are engaged in activities of daily living and 13    community support; too many of these employees earn wages 14    that place them and their families below the poverty 15    level.16        (2) In Illinois, nearly half of direct care workers 17    rely on public assistance to make ends meet, creating 18    additional expenditures for State government; low wages 19    are a consequence of the historically low reimbursement 20    rates paid by the State of Illinois to community-based 21    service providers. 22        (3) The lack of adequate wages for employees who 23    perform the challenging work of supporting persons with   HB3089- 2 -LRB104 06905 KTG 16941 b1    intellectual and developmental disabilities results in 2    high employee turnover, which in turn negatively impacts 3    the quality of services provided, higher wages are proven 4    to reduce staff turnover, improving stability and quality 5    of services while reducing employer training costs.6        (4) Rising wages in other sectors now means, despite 7    modest wage increases and strenuous efforts to recruit new 8    workers, agencies are struggling to fill positions and 9    keep them filled with 90% of community providers 10    experiencing staffing challenges. Excessive vacancies 11    force employers to rely more on overtime, with providers 12    reporting an average of 11,000 hours of staff overtime a 13    month, leading to staff burnout and driving up costs.14        (5) A December 2020 report issued by an independent 15    consulting group commissioned by the State to propose 16    changes to the State's reimbursement for community 17    disability agencies recommended that addressing DSP wages 18    was the number one priority for ensuring compliance with 19    the mandates of the Ligas Consent Decree, and further 20    recommended that wages for DSPs should be fixed at 150% of 21    the prevailing minimum wage plus additional funding for 22    benefits.23        (6) The difference between 150% of the State minimum 24    wage on January 1, 2025 and the hourly DSP wage rate set by 25    the State amounts to $2.00 per hour.26        (7) The General Assembly finds that in order to reduce   HB3089- 3 -LRB104 06905 KTG 16941 b1    turnover, increase retention, fill vacancies, and ensure 2    DSPs are adequately compensated for the critically 3    important work they do, an increase in rates and 4    reimbursements to community-based service providers to 5    effectuate an increase in the hourly wage paid to DSPs is 6    needed. 7    Section 3. Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of this 8Act to increase the wages of DSPs and other front-line staff in 9community disability agencies beyond the poverty level and to 10a level competitive with rival employers and above the State 11minimum wage, in an effort to improve the lives of DSPs and the 12lives of the vulnerable persons they support. 13    It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that all 14funds resulting from rate increases provided to community 15disability agencies are allocated to front-line employee wages 16in order to address the current workforce crisis which is the 17primary obstacle to the availability of community-based 18services for people with disabilities. 19    Section 5. The Illinois Administrative Procedure Act is 20amended by adding Section 5-45.65 as follows: 21    (5 ILCS 100/5-45.65 new)22    Sec. 5-45.65.
