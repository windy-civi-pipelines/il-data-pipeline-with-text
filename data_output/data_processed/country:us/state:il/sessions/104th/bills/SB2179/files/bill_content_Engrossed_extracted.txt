In the 12    absence of an audible signal or horn, a light signal 13    device using the appropriate number of rapid bursts of 14    light may be used. 15    D. Sailing vessels. 16        (1) The operator of a power-driven vessel shall yield 17    the right-of-way to any nonpowered or sailing vessel 18    unless the nonpowered vessel is overtaking the 19    power-driven vessel or when a large craft is navigating in 20    a confined channel, the large craft has the right-of-way 21    over a boat propelled solely by oars or sails.22        (2) If 2 sailing vessels are approaching one another, 23    so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep 24    out of the way of the other as follows:25            (a) If each has the wind on a different side, the 26        vessel that has the wind on the port side shall give   SB2179 Engrossed- 18 -LRB104 12160 LNS 22261 b1        way to the other vessel.2            (b) If both have the wind on the same side, the 3        vessel that is to windward shall give way to the vessel 4        that is to leeward.5            (c) If a vessel with the wind on the port side sees 6        a vessel to windward and cannot determine with 7        certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on the 8        port or starboard side, the vessel shall give way to 9        the other vessel. 10(Source: P.A. 102-595, eff. 6-1-22.) 11    (625 ILCS 45/5-18)  (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 315-13)12    Sec. 5-18.
