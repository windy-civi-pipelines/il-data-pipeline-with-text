On and after July 1, 1996, all 4    nursing home prescreenings for individuals 18 through 59 5    years of age shall be conducted by the Department, or a 6    designee of the Department.7        The Department is authorized to establish a system of 8    recipient cost-sharing for services provided under this 9    Section. The cost-sharing shall be based upon the 10    recipient's ability to pay for services, but in no case 11    shall the recipient's share exceed the actual cost of the 12    services provided. Protected income shall not be 13    considered by the Department in its determination of the 14    recipient's ability to pay a share of the cost of 15    services. The level of cost-sharing shall be adjusted each 16    year to reflect changes in the "protected income" level. 17    The Department shall deduct from the recipient's share of 18    the cost of services any money expended by the recipient 19    for disability-related expenses.20        To the extent permitted under the federal Social 21    Security Act, the Department, or the Department's 22    authorized representative, may recover the amount of 23    moneys expended for services provided to or in behalf of a 24    person under this Section by a claim against the person's 25    estate or against the estate of the person's surviving 26    spouse, but no recovery may be had until after the death of   SB1997- 30 -LRB104 11042 KTG 21124 b1    the surviving spouse, if any, and then only at such time 2    when there is no surviving child who is under age 21 or 3    blind or who has a permanent and total disability. This 4    paragraph, however, shall not bar recovery, at the death 5    of the person, of moneys for services provided to the 6    person or in behalf of the person under this Section to 7    which the person was not entitled; provided that such 8    recovery shall not be enforced against any real estate 9    while it is occupied as a homestead by the surviving 10    spouse or other dependent, if no claims by other creditors 11    have been filed against the estate, or, if such claims 12    have been filed, they remain dormant for failure of 13    prosecution or failure of the claimant to compel 14    administration of the estate for the purpose of payment. 15    This paragraph shall not bar recovery from the estate of a 16    spouse, under Sections 1915 and 1924 of the Social 17    Security Act and Section 5-4 of the Illinois Public Aid 18    Code, who precedes a person receiving services under this 19    Section in death. All moneys for services paid to or in 20    behalf of the person under this Section shall be claimed 21    for recovery from the deceased spouse's estate. 22    "Homestead", as used in this paragraph, means the dwelling 23    house and contiguous real estate occupied by a surviving 24    spouse or relative, as defined by the rules and 25    regulations of the Department of Healthcare and Family 26    Services, regardless of the value of the property.  SB1997- 31 -LRB104 11042 KTG 21124 b1        (g) To establish such subdivisions of the Department 2    as shall be desirable and assign to the various 3    subdivisions the responsibilities and duties placed upon 4    the Department by law.5        (h) To cooperate and enter into any necessary 6    agreements with the Department of Employment Security for 7    the provision of job placement and job referral services 8    to clients of the Department, including job service 9    registration of such clients with Illinois Employment 10    Security offices and making job listings maintained by the 11    Department of Employment Security available to such 12    clients.13        (i) To possess all powers reasonable and necessary for 14    the exercise and administration of the powers, duties and 15    responsibilities of the Department which are provided for 16    by law.17        (j) (Blank).18        (k) (Blank).19        (l) To establish, operate, and maintain a Statewide 20    Housing Clearinghouse of information on available 21    government subsidized housing accessible to persons with 22    disabilities and available privately owned housing 23    accessible to persons with disabilities.

Home care and home health 18    workers who function as personal assistants and individual 19    maintenance home health workers and who also provide 20    services under the Department's Home Services Program 21    shall not be covered by the State Employees Group 22    Insurance Act of 1971.23        The Department shall execute, relative to nursing home 24    prescreening, as authorized by Section 4.03 of the 25    Illinois Act on the Aging, written inter-agency agreements 26    with the Department on Aging and the Department of   SB1997- 29 -LRB104 11042 KTG 21124 b1    Healthcare and Family Services, to effect the intake 2    procedures and eligibility criteria for those persons who 3    may need long term care. On and after July 1, 1996, all 4    nursing home prescreenings for individuals 18 through 59 5    years of age shall be conducted by the Department, or a 6    designee of the Department.7        The Department is authorized to establish a system of 8    recipient cost-sharing for services provided under this 9    Section. The cost-sharing shall be based upon the 10    recipient's ability to pay for services, but in no case 11    shall the recipient's share exceed the actual cost of the 12    services provided. Protected income shall not be 13    considered by the Department in its determination of the 14    recipient's ability to pay a share of the cost of 15    services. The level of cost-sharing shall be adjusted each 16    year to reflect changes in the "protected income" level. 17    The Department shall deduct from the recipient's share of 18    the cost of services any money expended by the recipient 19    for disability-related expenses.20        To the extent permitted under the federal Social 21    Security Act, the Department, or the Department's 22    authorized representative, may recover the amount of 23    moneys expended for services provided to or in behalf of a 24    person under this Section by a claim against the person's 25    estate or against the estate of the person's surviving 26    spouse, but no recovery may be had until after the death of   SB1997- 30 -LRB104 11042 KTG 21124 b1    the surviving spouse, if any, and then only at such time 2    when there is no surviving child who is under age 21 or 3    blind or who has a permanent and total disability. This 4    paragraph, however, shall not bar recovery, at the death 5    of the person, of moneys for services provided to the 6    person or in behalf of the person under this Section to 7    which the person was not entitled; provided that such 8    recovery shall not be enforced against any real estate 9    while it is occupied as a homestead by the surviving 10    spouse or other dependent, if no claims by other creditors 11    have been filed against the estate, or, if such claims 12    have been filed, they remain dormant for failure of 13    prosecution or failure of the claimant to compel 14    administration of the estate for the purpose of payment. 15    This paragraph shall not bar recovery from the estate of a 16    spouse, under Sections 1915 and 1924 of the Social 17    Security Act and Section 5-4 of the Illinois Public Aid 18    Code, who precedes a person receiving services under this 19    Section in death. All moneys for services paid to or in 20    behalf of the person under this Section shall be claimed 21    for recovery from the deceased spouse's estate. 22    "Homestead", as used in this paragraph, means the dwelling 23    house and contiguous real estate occupied by a surviving 24    spouse or relative, as defined by the rules and 25    regulations of the Department of Healthcare and Family 26    Services, regardless of the value of the property.  SB1997- 31 -LRB104 11042 KTG 21124 b1        (g) To establish such subdivisions of the Department 2    as shall be desirable and assign to the various 3    subdivisions the responsibilities and duties placed upon 4    the Department by law.5        (h) To cooperate and enter into any necessary 6    agreements with the Department of Employment Security for 7    the provision of job placement and job referral services 8    to clients of the Department, including job service 9    registration of such clients with Illinois Employment 10    Security offices and making job listings maintained by the 11    Department of Employment Security available to such 12    clients.13        (i) To possess all powers reasonable and necessary for 14    the exercise and administration of the powers, duties and 15    responsibilities of the Department which are provided for 16    by law.17        (j) (Blank).18        (k) (Blank).19        (l) To establish, operate, and maintain a Statewide 20    Housing Clearinghouse of information on available 21    government subsidized housing accessible to persons with 22    disabilities and available privately owned housing 23    accessible to persons with disabilities. The information 24    shall include, but not be limited to, the location, rental 25    requirements, access features and proximity to public 26    transportation of available housing. The Clearinghouse   SB1997- 32 -LRB104 11042 KTG 21124 b1    shall consist of at least a computerized database for the 2    storage and retrieval of information and a separate or 3    shared toll free telephone number for use by those seeking 4    information from the Clearinghouse. Department offices and 5    personnel throughout the State shall also assist in the 6    operation of the Statewide Housing Clearinghouse. 7    Cooperation with local, State, and federal housing 8    managers shall be sought and extended in order to 9    frequently and promptly update the Clearinghouse's 10    information.11        (m) To assure that the names and case records of 12    persons who received or are receiving services from the 13    Department, including persons receiving vocational 14    rehabilitation, home services, or other services, and 15    those attending one of the Department's schools or other 16    supervised facility shall be confidential and not be open 17    to the general public. Those case records and reports or 18    the information contained in those records and reports 19    shall be disclosed by the Director only to proper law 20    enforcement officials, individuals authorized by a court, 21    the General Assembly or any committee or commission of the 22    General Assembly, and other persons and for reasons as the 23    Director designates by rule. Disclosure by the Director 24    may be only in accordance with other applicable law.25(Source: P.A. 102-264, eff. 8-6-21; 102-826, eff. 5-13-22; 26103-479, eff. 1-1-24.)
