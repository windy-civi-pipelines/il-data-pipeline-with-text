State agencies shall 11report to the Department all projects that did not comply with 12the Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative and any action 13taken against the noncompliant party and shall provide an 14action plan to address the reported instance of noncompliance 15with the Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative. 16    (d) No later than one year after the effective date of this 17Act, and by April 1 of every calendar year thereafter, the 18Department of Labor shall submit a report to the Illinois 19Works Review Panel regarding the use of apprentices under the 20Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative for public works 21projects. To the extent it is available, the report shall 22include the following information: 23        (1) the total number of labor hours on each project 24    and the percentage of labor hours actually worked by 25    apprentices on each public works project; 26        (2) the number of apprentices used in each public   SB1691- 13 -LRB104 09975 HLH 20045 b1    works project, broken down by trade; and 2        (3) the number and percentage of minorities, women, 3    and veterans utilized as apprentices on each public works 4    project. 5    (e) The Department shall adopt any rules deemed necessary 6to implement the Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative. In 7order to provide for the expeditious and timely implementation 8of this Act, the Department may adopt emergency rules.

Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative. 3    (a) The Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative is 4established and shall be administered by the Department. 5        (1) Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection 6    (b) of this Section, apprentices shall be utilized on all 7    public works projects estimated to cost $500,000 or more 8    in accordance with this subsection (a). 9        (2) For public works projects estimated to cost 10    $500,000 or more, the goal of the Illinois Works 11    Apprenticeship Initiative is that apprentices will perform 12    either 10% of the total labor hours actually worked in 13    each prevailing wage classification or 10% of the 14    estimated labor hours in each prevailing wage 15    classification, whichever is less. For contracts and grant 16    agreements executed after the effective date of this 17    amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly and before 18    January 1, 2024, of this goal, at least 25% of the labor 19    hours of each prevailing wage classification performed by 20    apprentices shall be performed by graduates of the 21    Illinois Works Preapprenticeship Program, the Illinois 22    Climate Works Preapprenticeship Program, or the Highway 23    Construction Careers Training Program. For contracts and 24    grant agreements executed on or after January 1, 2024, of 25    this goal, at least 50% of the labor hours of each 26    prevailing wage classification performed by apprentices   SB1691- 10 -LRB104 09975 HLH 20045 b1    shall be performed by graduates of the Illinois Works 2    Preapprenticeship Program, the Illinois Climate Works 3    Preapprenticeship Program, or the Highway Construction 4    Careers Training Program. 5    (b) Before or during the term of a contract subject to this 6Section, the Department may reduce or waive the goals set 7forth in paragraph (2) of subsection (a). Prior to the 8Department granting a request for a reduction or waiver, the 9Department shall determine, in its discretion, whether to hold 10a public hearing on the request. In determining whether to 11hold a public hearing, the Department may consider factors, 12including the scale of the project and whether the contractor 13or subcontractor seeking the reduction or waiver has 14previously requested reductions or waivers on other projects. 15The Department may also consult with the Business Enterprise 16Council under the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, 17and Persons with Disabilities Act and the Chief Procurement 18Officer of the agency administering the public works contract. 19The Department may grant a reduction or waiver upon a 20determination that: 21        (1) the contractor or subcontractor has demonstrated 22    that insufficient apprentices are available; 23        (2) the reasonable and necessary requirements of the 24    contract do not allow the goal to be met;25        (3) there is a disproportionately high ratio of 26    material costs to labor hours that makes meeting the goal   SB1691- 11 -LRB104 09975 HLH 20045 b1    infeasible;2        (4) apprentice labor hour goals conflict with existing 3    requirements, including federal requirements, in 4    connection with the public work; or 5        (5) the contractor or subcontractor has demonstrated 6    that insufficient graduates of the Illinois Works 7    Preapprenticeship Program are available to meet the 8    requirements of paragraph (2) of subsection (a). 9    (c) Contractors and subcontractors must submit a 10certification to the Department and the agency that is 11administering the contract, or the grant agreement funding the 12contract, demonstrating that the contractor or subcontractor 13has:14        (1) met the apprentice labor hour goals set forth in 15    paragraph (2) of subsection (a); 16        (2) received a reduction or waiver pursuant to 17    subsection (b); or 18        (3) not complied with the labor hour goals in 19    paragraph (2) of subsection (a) and did not receive a 20    reduction or waiver pursuant to subsection (b). 21    It shall be deemed to be a material breach of the contract, 22or the grant agreement funding the contract, and entitle the 23State to declare a default, terminate the contract or grant 24agreement funding it, and exercise those remedies provided for 25in the contract, at law, or in equity if the contractor or 26subcontractor fails to submit the certification required in   SB1691- 12 -LRB104 09975 HLH 20045 b1this subsection or submits false or misleading information. 2    Intentional failure to comply with the Illinois Works 3Apprenticeship Initiative may result in the State agency that 4contracted or funded the public works project: (i) terminating 5the contract or agreement involved, (ii) prohibiting the party 6that contracted with the State from participating in public 7contracts or agreements for a period not to exceed 3 years, 8(iii) seeking a penalty of up to 25% of the contract or 9agreement as a result of the violation, or (iv) any 10combination of items (i) through (iii). State agencies shall 11report to the Department all projects that did not comply with 12the Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative and any action 13taken against the noncompliant party and shall provide an 14action plan to address the reported instance of noncompliance 15with the Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative. 16    (d) No later than one year after the effective date of this 17Act, and by April 1 of every calendar year thereafter, the 18Department of Labor shall submit a report to the Illinois 19Works Review Panel regarding the use of apprentices under the 20Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative for public works 21projects. To the extent it is available, the report shall 22include the following information: 23        (1) the total number of labor hours on each project 24    and the percentage of labor hours actually worked by 25    apprentices on each public works project; 26        (2) the number of apprentices used in each public   SB1691- 13 -LRB104 09975 HLH 20045 b1    works project, broken down by trade; and 2        (3) the number and percentage of minorities, women, 3    and veterans utilized as apprentices on each public works 4    project. 5    (e) The Department shall adopt any rules deemed necessary 6to implement the Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative. In 7order to provide for the expeditious and timely implementation 8of this Act, the Department may adopt emergency rules. The 9adoption of emergency rules authorized by this subsection is 10deemed to be necessary for the public interest, safety, and 11welfare. 12    (f) The Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative shall not 13interfere with any contracts or grants in existence on the 14effective date of this Act. 15    (g) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this 16Act, any State agency that administers a construction program 17for which federal law or regulations establish standards and 18procedures for the utilization of apprentices may implement 19the Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative using the federal 20standards and procedures for the establishment of goals and 21utilization procedures for the State-funded, as well as the 22federally assisted, portions of the program. In such cases, 23these goals shall not exceed those established pursuant to the 24relevant federal statutes or regulations.25    (h) The Department shall maintain a list of graduates of 26the Illinois Works Preapprenticeship Program for a period of   SB1691- 14 -LRB104 09975 HLH 20045 b1not less than one year after the participant graduates from 2the Program. The list shall include the name, address, county 3of residence, phone number, email address, and the 4self-attested construction and building trade career path 5preferences of each graduate. This list shall be made 6available to any contractor or subcontractor, as well as any 7apprenticeship program approved by and registered with the 8United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Apprenticeship 9and Training in alignment with the graduate's self-attested 10construction and building trade career path preferences. 11Subject to approval of the Department, community-based 12organizations may be authorized to provide services pursuant 13to this subsection (h) of Section 20-20 of this Act. 14(Source: P.A. 103-305, eff. 7-28-23.) 15    (30 ILCS 559/20-25)16    Sec. 20-25.
