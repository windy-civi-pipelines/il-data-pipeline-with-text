The 20    prescribing provider may make a secure electronic 21    signature beside the words "certification of medical 22    necessity", and this certification shall authorize 23    continuation of coverage for the drug.24        If the prescribing provider certifies to the health 25    care plan either in writing or electronically that the 26    drug is medically necessary for the enrollee as provided   10400HB3796ham002- 10 -LRB104 09757 BAB 24954 a1    in paragraph (C), a health care plan shall authorize 2    coverage for the drug prescribed based solely on the 3    prescribing provider's assertion that coverage is 4    medically necessary, and the health care plan is 5    prohibited from making modifications to the coverage 6    related to the covered drug, including, but not limited 7    to: 8            (i) increasing the out-of-pocket costs for the 9        covered drug;10            (ii) moving the covered drug to a more restrictive 11        tier; or 12            (iii) denying an enrollee coverage of the drug for 13        which the enrollee has been previously approved for 14        coverage by the health care plan. 15        Nothing in this item (3) prevents a health care plan 16    from removing a drug from its formulary or denying an 17    enrollee coverage if the United States Food and Drug 18    Administration has issued a statement about the drug that 19    calls into question the clinical safety of the drug, the 20    drug manufacturer has notified the United States Food and 21    Drug Administration of a manufacturing discontinuance or 22    potential discontinuance of the drug as required by 23    Section 506C of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 24    as codified in 21 U.S.C. 356c, or the drug manufacturer 25    has removed the drug from the market. 26        Nothing in this item (3) prohibits a health care plan,   10400HB3796ham002- 11 -LRB104 09757 BAB 24954 a1    by contract, written policy or procedure, or any other 2    agreement or course of conduct, from requiring a 3    pharmacist to effect substitutions of prescription drugs 4    consistent with Section 19.5 of the Pharmacy Practice Act, 5    under which a pharmacist may substitute an interchangeable 6    biologic for a prescribed biologic product, and Section 25 7    of the Pharmacy Practice Act, under which a pharmacist may 8    select a generic drug determined to be therapeutically 9    equivalent by the United States Food and Drug 10    Administration and in accordance with the Illinois Food, 11    Drug and Cosmetic Act. 12        This item (3) applies to a policy or contract that is 13    amended, delivered, issued, or renewed on or after January 14    1, 2019.

In 14no event shall this Section be construed to prohibit the 15addition of prescription drugs to a health care plan's list of 16covered drugs during the coverage year. 17    (d) In this Section, "ongoing course of treatment" has the 18meaning ascribed to that term in Section 5 of the Network 19Adequacy and Transparency Act. 20(Source: P.A. 103-650, eff. 1-1-25.) 21    Section 99.
