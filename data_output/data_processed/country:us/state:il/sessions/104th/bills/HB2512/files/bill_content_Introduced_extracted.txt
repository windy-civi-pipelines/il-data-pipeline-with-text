Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Accountability in Psychotropic Drug Prescriptions for Children 6Under Medicaid Act. 7    Section 5. Legislative findings. The General Assembly 8finds the following:9        (1) In 2023, Illinois' Medicaid program statistics 10    showed 96,841 children and adolescents aged 0-17 being 11    prescribed psychotropic drugs, including 7,227 children 12    aged 0-5.13        (2) The administration of nearly every psychotropic 14    drug to children aged 0-5 is off-label, meaning the drugs 15    are being prescribed for age groups not approved by the 16    U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).17        (3) Psychotropic drugs, including stimulants, 18    antidepressants, antipsychotics, and other behavioral 19    drugs, are being prescribed to children using Medicaid 20    funding and are documented by the FDA to include severe 21    side effects, including, but not limited to, addiction, 22    suicidal ideation, aggression, hallucinations, 23    cardiovascular events, stunted growth, and developmental   HB2512- 2 -LRB104 10052 KTG 20123 b1    concerns.2        (4) Parents and caregivers are frequently not informed 3    of the FDA-documented risks associated with the 4    psychotropics being prescribed, including the pediatric 5    risks.6        (5) Section 208.20 of Title 21 of the United States 7    Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) establishes the 8    requirement for FDA Medication Guides to provide easily 9    understandable information about the risks and side 10    effects of prescription drugs for the average consumer, 11    including parents and caregivers. According to federal 12    regulations, Medication Guides must:13            (A) Detail "the particular serious and significant 14        public health concern that has created the need for 15        the Medication Guide". 16            (B) Note any known "pediatric risks".17            (C) Include the risk of "patients developing 18        dependence on the drug product".19            (D) Use a font size no smaller than 10-point.20            (E) Be written in "nontechnical, understandable 21        language". 22            (F) "Not be promotional in tone or content". 23        (6) To effectively monitor the effects of psychotropic 24    drugs prescribed to children and adolescents, particularly 25    the FDA-cited "pediatric effects", parents and caregivers 26    must be given a hard copy of the FDA Medication Guide for   HB2512- 3 -LRB104 10052 KTG 20123 b1    the psychotropic drug being prescribed.2        (7) Medicaid is a state and federally funded program 3    that provides essential healthcare services to vulnerable 4    populations, including children and adolescents. It should 5    be required to distribute the FDA Medication Guides to 6    ensure recipients and their guardians are fully informed 7    of the risks and potential adverse effects of psychotropic 8    medications, thereby supporting informed consent and 9    promoting patient safety.10        (8) A reliable system for parents and caregivers to 11    report adverse drug reactions to psychotropic drugs is 12    essential to help Medicaid agencies and legislators 13    monitor and assess the frequency, severity, and impact of 14    such reactions within the public sector.15        (9) The absence of an accessible, Medicaid-funded 16    reporting mechanism for drug side effects limits the 17    ability to identify and address these risks effectively, 18    compromising the safety of children and adolescents.19        (10) Medicaid is the primary payer for psychotropic 20    medications prescribed to children and adolescents in the 21    public sector, including for off-label use in children as 22    young as 0-5 years, making it directly responsible for 23    ensuring the safety and monitoring of these prescriptions.24        (11) Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to psychotropic 25    medications can have significant physical, psychological, 26    and developmental impacts on children, requiring timely   HB2512- 4 -LRB104 10052 KTG 20123 b1    identification and response to mitigate harm.2        (12) The establishment of an online ADR reporting 3    system would enable the State's Medicaid program to 4    fulfill its duty of care by providing a mechanism to 5    collect critical safety data, support evidence-based 6    decision-making, and comply with its responsibility to 7    protect public health.8        (13) Funding this reporting system aligns with the 9    State's Medicaid program's obligations under federal law 10    to monitor and improve the quality of care provided to its 11    beneficiaries, especially vulnerable pediatric 12    populations, and would facilitate oversight and 13    accountability for the use of public funds in prescribing 14    psychotropic medications.15        (14) The provisions of this Act are established to 16    address these findings and enhance oversight, informed 17    consent, and accountability in psychotropic drug 18    prescriptions for children under the State's Medicaid 19    program. 20    Section 10. Definitions.
