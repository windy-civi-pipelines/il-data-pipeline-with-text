For purposes of 13    this subsection (p), when making a determination of 14    whether 30% or fewer of the units, by number, possess over 15    50% in the aggregate of the votes in the association, a 16    unit shall not include a garage unit or a storage unit. 17        (q) That a unit owner may not assign, delegate, 18    transfer, surrender, or avoid the duties, 19    responsibilities, and liabilities of a unit owner under 20    this Act, the condominium instruments, or the rules and 21    regulations of the Association; and that such an attempted 22    assignment, delegation, transfer, surrender, or avoidance 23    shall be deemed void.24    The provisions of this Section are applicable to all 25condominium instruments recorded under this Act. Any portion 26of a condominium instrument which contains provisions contrary   SB2125- 25 -LRB104 09818 JRC 19886 b1to these provisions shall be void as against public policy and 2ineffective. Any such instrument which fails to contain the 3provisions required by this Section shall be deemed to 4incorporate such provisions by operation of law.5(Source: P.A. 102-162, eff. 1-1-22.)

In addition to any other remedies, by filing 8    an action jointly against the tenant and the unit owner, 9    an association may seek to enjoin a tenant from occupying 10    a unit or seek to evict a tenant under the provisions of 11    Article IX of the Code of Civil Procedure for failure of 12    the lessor-owner to comply with the leasing requirements 13    prescribed by this Section or by the declaration, bylaws, 14    and rules and regulations. The board of managers may 15    proceed directly against a tenant, at law or in equity, or 16    under the provisions of Article IX of the Code of Civil 17    Procedure, for any other breach by tenant of any 18    covenants, rules, regulations or bylaws.19        (o) The association shall have no authority to forbear 20    the payment of assessments by any unit owner.21        (p) That when 30% or fewer of the units, by number, 22    possess over 50% in the aggregate of the votes in the 23    association, any percentage vote of members specified 24    herein or in the condominium instruments shall require the 25    specified percentage by number of units rather than by 26    percentage of interest in the common elements allocated to   SB2125- 24 -LRB104 09818 JRC 19886 b1    units that would otherwise be applicable and garage units 2    or storage units, or both, shall have, in total, no more 3    votes than their aggregate percentage of ownership in the 4    common elements; this shall mean that if garage units or 5    storage units, or both, are to be given a vote, or portion 6    of a vote, that the association must add the total number 7    of votes cast of garage units, storage units, or both, and 8    divide the total by the number of garage units, storage 9    units, or both, and multiply by the aggregate percentage 10    of ownership of garage units and storage units to 11    determine the vote, or portion of a vote, that garage 12    units or storage units, or both, have. For purposes of 13    this subsection (p), when making a determination of 14    whether 30% or fewer of the units, by number, possess over 15    50% in the aggregate of the votes in the association, a 16    unit shall not include a garage unit or a storage unit. 17        (q) That a unit owner may not assign, delegate, 18    transfer, surrender, or avoid the duties, 19    responsibilities, and liabilities of a unit owner under 20    this Act, the condominium instruments, or the rules and 21    regulations of the Association; and that such an attempted 22    assignment, delegation, transfer, surrender, or avoidance 23    shall be deemed void.24    The provisions of this Section are applicable to all 25condominium instruments recorded under this Act. Any portion 26of a condominium instrument which contains provisions contrary   SB2125- 25 -LRB104 09818 JRC 19886 b1to these provisions shall be void as against public policy and 2ineffective. Any such instrument which fails to contain the 3provisions required by this Section shall be deemed to 4incorporate such provisions by operation of law.5(Source: P.A. 102-162, eff. 1-1-22.)
