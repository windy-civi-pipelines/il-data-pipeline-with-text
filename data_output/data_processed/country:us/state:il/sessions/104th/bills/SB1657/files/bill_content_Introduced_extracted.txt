The district may not 15classify more funds as funds received in connection with the 16funding program than the district is entitled to receive in 17that fiscal year for that program. Any classification by a 18district must be made by a resolution of its board of 19education. The resolution must identify the amount of any 20payments or general State aid to be classified under this 21paragraph and must specify the funding program to which the 22funds are to be treated as received in connection therewith. 23This resolution is controlling as to the classification of 24funds referenced therein. A certified copy of the resolution 25must be sent to the State Superintendent of Education. The 26resolution shall still take effect even though a copy of the   SB1657- 11 -LRB104 07589 LNS 17633 b1resolution has not been sent to the State Superintendent of 2Education in a timely manner. No classification under this 3paragraph by a district shall affect the total amount or 4timing of money the district is entitled to receive under this 5Code. No classification under this paragraph by a district 6shall in any way relieve the district from or affect any 7requirements that otherwise would apply with respect to that 8funding program, including any accounting of funds by source, 9reporting expenditures by original source and purpose, 10reporting requirements, or requirements of providing services. 11    Any school district with a population of not more than 12500,000 must deposit all funds received under this Article 13into the transportation fund and use those funds for the 14provision of transportation services. 15(Source: P.A. 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 16103-588, eff. 1-1-25.)
