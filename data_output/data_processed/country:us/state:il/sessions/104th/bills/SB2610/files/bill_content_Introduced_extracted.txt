The 8Audit Expense Fund may receive transfers from those trust 9funds only as directed herein, except where prohibited by the 10terms of the trust fund agreement. The Auditor General shall 11notify the trustees of those funds of the estimated cost of the 12audit to be incurred under the Illinois State Auditing Act for 13the fund.

hereby authorizes the use of such funds 5for the purposes set forth in this Section.6    These provisions do not apply to funds classified by the 7Comptroller as federal trust funds or State trust funds. The 8Audit Expense Fund may receive transfers from those trust 9funds only as directed herein, except where prohibited by the 10terms of the trust fund agreement. The Auditor General shall 11notify the trustees of those funds of the estimated cost of the 12audit to be incurred under the Illinois State Auditing Act for 13the fund. The trustees of those funds shall direct the State 14Comptroller and Treasurer to transfer the estimated amount to 15the Audit Expense Fund.16    The Auditor General may bill entities that are not subject 17to the above transfer provisions, including private entities, 18related organizations and entities whose funds are 19locally-held, for the cost of audits, studies, and 20investigations incurred on their behalf. Any revenues received 21under this provision shall be deposited into the Audit Expense 22Fund.23    In the event that moneys on deposit in any fund are 24unavailable, by reason of deficiency or any other reason 25preventing their lawful transfer, the State Comptroller shall 26order transferred and the State Treasurer shall transfer the   SB2610- 15 -LRB104 03337 HLH 13359 b1amount deficient or otherwise unavailable from the General 2Revenue Fund for deposit into the Audit Expense Fund.3    On or before December 1, 1992, and each December 1 4thereafter, the Auditor General shall notify the Governor's 5Office of Management and Budget (formerly Bureau of the 6Budget) of the amount estimated to be necessary to pay for 7audits, studies, and investigations in accordance with the 8Illinois State Auditing Act during the next succeeding fiscal 9year for each State fund for which a transfer or reimbursement 10is anticipated.11    Beginning with fiscal year 1994 and during each fiscal 12year thereafter, the Auditor General may direct the State 13Comptroller and Treasurer to transfer moneys from funds 14authorized by the General Assembly for that fund. In the event 15funds, including federal and State trust funds but excluding 16the General Revenue Fund, are transferred, during fiscal year 171994 and during each fiscal year thereafter, in excess of the 18amount to pay actual costs attributable to audits, studies, 19and investigations as permitted or required by the Illinois 20State Auditing Act or specific action of the General Assembly, 21the Auditor General shall, on September 30, or as soon 22thereafter as is practicable, direct the State Comptroller and 23Treasurer to transfer the excess amount back to the fund from 24which it was originally transferred.25(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-699, eff. 4-19-22; 26103-8, eff. 6-7-23; 103-129, eff. 6-30-23; 103-588, eff.   SB2610- 16 -LRB104 03337 HLH 13359 b16-5-24.) 2    Section 99.
