For the special care of any lot, grave, crypt, or 22    niche or of a family mausoleum, memorial, marker, or 23    monument, the full amount received.24    Such setting aside and deposit shall be made by such 25cemetery authority not later than 30 days after the close of 26the month in which the cemetery authority gave away for an   SB2010- 12 -LRB104 11189 JRC 21271 b1imputed value or received the final payment on the purchase 2price of interment rights, entombment rights, or inurnment 3rights, or received the final payment for the general or 4special care of a lot, grave, crypt or niche or of a family 5mausoleum, memorial, marker or monument; and such amounts 6shall be held by the trustee of the care funds of such cemetery 7authority in trust in perpetuity for the specific purposes 8stated in said written instrument.

In the event of the seller's bankruptcy, 20insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or an 21adverse judgment, the trust funds shall not be available to 22any creditor as assets of the cemetery authority or to pay any 23expenses of any bankruptcy or similar proceeding, but shall be 24retained intact to provide for the future maintenance of the 25cemetery. Except in an action by the Comptroller to revoke a 26license issued pursuant to this Act and for creation of a   SB2010- 14 -LRB104 11189 JRC 21271 b1receivership as provided in this Act, the trust shall not be 2subject to judgment, execution, garnishment, attachment, or 3other seizure by process in bankruptcy or otherwise, nor to 4sale, pledge, mortgage, or other alienation, and shall not be 5assignable except as approved by the Comptroller. The changes 6made by this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly are 7intended to clarify existing law regarding the inability of 8licensees to pledge the trust.9(Source: P.A. 91-7, eff. 6-1-99.) 10    (760 ILCS 100/4.1 new)11    Sec. 4.1.

If the trustee does not receive written 6instructions from the cemetery authority informing the trustee 7of the method of calculating chosen, then the trustee shall 8calculate and distribute based on the ordinary income 9distribution method.

The notification shall 14contain details of the information needed to remedy any 15deficiencies in the application. 16    (c) The total return percentage elected may be reduced but 17may not be increased unless additional application is made to 18the Comptroller with documentation demonstrating the rate of 19return of the care funds over the last 3 years to support an 20increase in the percentage. The total return distribution 21shall not exceed 5% of the average fair market value of the 22fund assets in a given calendar year. 23    (d) A cemetery authority that has elected the total return 24distribution method may elect to reconvert to the ordinary 25income distribution method by submitting written documentation 26to the Comptroller in support of the reconversion, including a   SB2010- 17 -LRB104 11189 JRC 21271 b1copy of the trust agreement, notification on the proposed 2effective date of the reconversion, and any additional 3information required by the Comptroller. 4    (e) The Comptroller may take corrective measures, 5including reducing the total return percentage or requiring a 6distribution of only ordinary income for a year under one or 7more of the following circumstances: 8        (1) if the average fair market value of the care fund 9    from one 3-year period to the previous 3-year period 10    declines by 10% or more;11        (2) if the average fair market value of the care fund 12    declines by more than 30% during a rolling 5-year period; 13        (3) if the fair market value of the fund at the 14    beginning of a fiscal year is less than 80% of the fair 15    market value of the fund on the first day of the fiscal 16    year when the care fund started making distributions based 17    on the total return distribution method; 18        (4) if there is an uncorrected care fund deficiency as 19    determined by the Comptroller's review of the annual 20    report; or 21        (5) if the Comptroller determines that the trustee is 22    not able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge and expertise 23    regarding the effective implementation of distributing 24    income for the maintenance of the cemetery using the total 25    return distribution method. 26    (f) The Comptroller may evaluate the care fund conditions   SB2010- 18 -LRB104 11189 JRC 21271 b1and choose not to impose corrective measures if the 2Comptroller finds that: 3        (1) the reasons are due to unusual or temporary 4    factors not within the control of the cemetery authority 5    or the trustee and that could not have been reasonably 6    anticipated; 7        (2) the current investment policy of the fund is 8    reasonably designed to protect the fund from further 9    declines in fair market value; or 10        (3) the exception appears to be both necessary and 11    appropriate for the continued protections of the care 12    fund.  13    (760 ILCS 100/5)  (from Ch. 21, par. 64.5)14    Sec. 5.

The notification shall 14contain details of the information needed to remedy any 15deficiencies in the application. 16    (c) The total return percentage elected may be reduced but 17may not be increased unless additional application is made to 18the Comptroller with documentation demonstrating the rate of 19return of the care funds over the last 3 years to support an 20increase in the percentage. The total return distribution 21shall not exceed 5% of the average fair market value of the 22fund assets in a given calendar year. 23    (d) A cemetery authority that has elected the total return 24distribution method may elect to reconvert to the ordinary 25income distribution method by submitting written documentation 26to the Comptroller in support of the reconversion, including a   SB2010- 17 -LRB104 11189 JRC 21271 b1copy of the trust agreement, notification on the proposed 2effective date of the reconversion, and any additional 3information required by the Comptroller. 4    (e) The Comptroller may take corrective measures, 5including reducing the total return percentage or requiring a 6distribution of only ordinary income for a year under one or 7more of the following circumstances: 8        (1) if the average fair market value of the care fund 9    from one 3-year period to the previous 3-year period 10    declines by 10% or more;11        (2) if the average fair market value of the care fund 12    declines by more than 30% during a rolling 5-year period; 13        (3) if the fair market value of the fund at the 14    beginning of a fiscal year is less than 80% of the fair 15    market value of the fund on the first day of the fiscal 16    year when the care fund started making distributions based 17    on the total return distribution method; 18        (4) if there is an uncorrected care fund deficiency as 19    determined by the Comptroller's review of the annual 20    report; or 21        (5) if the Comptroller determines that the trustee is 22    not able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge and expertise 23    regarding the effective implementation of distributing 24    income for the maintenance of the cemetery using the total 25    return distribution method. 26    (f) The Comptroller may evaluate the care fund conditions   SB2010- 18 -LRB104 11189 JRC 21271 b1and choose not to impose corrective measures if the 2Comptroller finds that: 3        (1) the reasons are due to unusual or temporary 4    factors not within the control of the cemetery authority 5    or the trustee and that could not have been reasonably 6    anticipated; 7        (2) the current investment policy of the fund is 8    reasonably designed to protect the fund from further 9    declines in fair market value; or 10        (3) the exception appears to be both necessary and 11    appropriate for the continued protections of the care 12    fund.  13    (760 ILCS 100/5)  (from Ch. 21, par. 64.5)14    Sec. 5.
