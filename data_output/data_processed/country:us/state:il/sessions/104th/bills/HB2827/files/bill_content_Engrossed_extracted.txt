Full Text of HB2827 ILGA.GOV HB2827 - 104th General Assembly HB2827 EngrossedLRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1    AN ACT concerning education. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Homeschool Act. 6    Section 5. Application. Nothing in this Act applies to 7schools registered or recognized under Section 2-3.25 of the 8School Code.  9    Section 10. Findings. The General Assembly finds:10        (1) Homeschool is a viable alternative to public 11    education when engaged in good faith and for the benefit 12    of students.13        (2) Homeschool is currently the fastest growing form 14    of education in the United States, yet the true number of 15    homeschool students is unknown and will continue to be 16    unknown without notification.17        (3) Abusers in this State have taken advantage of a 18    lack of notification to remove vulnerable students from 19    the supervision of mandatory reporters under the false 20    pretense of homeschool.21        (4) When abusers take students out of school under the 22    false pretense of homeschool, it conflates legitimate   HB2827 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1    homeschool with abuse and threatens the rights of those 2    families who homeschool in good faith and for the benefit 3    of their students.4        (5) The State does not have an adequate system to 5    further investigate signs of abuse once the abuser claims 6    the removal of a vulnerable student from the supervision 7    of mandatory reporters was under the false pretense of 8    homeschool.9        (6) The State's lack of process to investigate signs 10    of abuse further delegitimizes homeschool as a viable 11    alternative to public school.12        (7) A notification process and investigation of 13    educational neglect only after there is reasonable cause 14    to believe a student is suffering from educational neglect 15    is the least restrictive way for the State to protect 16    vulnerable students removed from the presence of mandatory 17    reporters under the false pretense of homeschool. 18    Section 15.

Registration and recognition of non-public 10elementary and secondary schools. 11    (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds and declares (i) 12that the Constitution of the State of Illinois provides that a 13"fundamental goal of the People of the State is the 14educational development of all persons to the limits of their 15capacities" and (ii) that the educational development of every 16school student serves the public purposes of the State. In 17order to ensure that all Illinois students and teachers have 18the opportunity to enroll and work in State-approved 19educational institutions and programs, the State Board of 20Education shall provide for the voluntary registration and 21recognition of non-public elementary and secondary schools. 22    (b) Registration. All non-public elementary and secondary 23schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily register with 24the State Board of Education on an annual basis. However,   HB2827 Engrossed- 24 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1beginning on August 1, 2026, all non-public elementary and 2secondary schools in the State of Illinois shall register with 3the State Board of Education on an annual basis. Registration 4shall be completed in conformance with procedures prescribed 5by the State Board of Education. Information required for 6registration shall include assurances of compliance (i) with 7federal and State laws regarding health examination and 8immunization, attendance, length of term, and 9nondiscrimination, including assurances that the school will 10not prohibit hairstyles historically associated with race, 11ethnicity, or hair texture, including, but not limited to, 12protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists, and 13(ii) with applicable fire and health safety requirements, 14(iii) with the requirement that all individuals in the school 15assigned to a teaching or administrative position hold, at a 16minimum, a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, 17(iv) with the requirement to maintain in its own records a list 18of every attending student's name, date of birth, grade level, 19address of residence, and the name and address of residence of 20at least one parent or guardian of each attending student, and 21(v) to confirm or deny to a truancy officer whether a 22particular student is enrolled and attending during the course 23of a truancy investigation under Article 26 of this Code.24    (c) Recognition. All non-public elementary and secondary 25schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily seek the 26status of "Non-public School Recognition" from the State Board   HB2827 Engrossed- 25 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1of Education. This status may be obtained by compliance with 2administrative guidelines and review procedures as prescribed 3by the State Board of Education. The guidelines and procedures 4must recognize that some of the aims and the financial bases of 5non-public schools are different from public schools and will 6not be identical to those for public schools, nor will they be 7more burdensome. The guidelines and procedures must also 8recognize the diversity of non-public schools and shall not 9impinge upon the noneducational relationships between those 10schools and their clientele. 11    (c-5) Prohibition against recognition. A non-public 12elementary or secondary school may not obtain "Non-public 13School Recognition" status unless the school requires all 14certified and non-certified applicants for employment with the 15school, after July 1, 2007, to authorize a fingerprint-based 16criminal history records check as a condition of employment to 17determine if such applicants have been convicted of any of the 18enumerated criminal or drug offenses set forth in Section 1921B-80 of this Code or have been convicted, within 7 years of 20the application for employment, of any other felony under the 21laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in 22any other state or against the laws of the United States that, 23if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 24punishable as a felony under the laws of this State.25    Authorization for the check shall be furnished by the 26applicant to the school, except that if the applicant is a   HB2827 Engrossed- 26 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one 2non-public school, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time 3employment positions with more than one non-public school (as 4a reading specialist, special education teacher, or 5otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee 6seeking employment positions with more than one non-public 7school, then only one of the non-public schools employing the 8individual shall request the authorization. Upon receipt of 9this authorization, the non-public school shall submit the 10applicant's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security 11number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as 12prescribed by the Illinois State Police, to the Illinois State 13Police.14    The Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of 15Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based 16criminal history records check, records of convictions, 17forever and hereafter, until expunged, to the president or 18principal of the non-public school that requested the check. 19The Illinois State Police shall charge that school a fee for 20conducting such check, which fee must be deposited into the 21State Police Services Fund and must not exceed the cost of the 22inquiry. Subject to appropriations for these purposes, the 23State Superintendent of Education shall reimburse non-public 24schools for fees paid to obtain criminal history records 25checks under this Section.26    A non-public school may not obtain recognition status   HB2827 Engrossed- 27 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1unless the school also performs a check of the Statewide Sex 2Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community 3Notification Law, and the Statewide Murderer and Violent 4Offender Against Youth Database, as authorized by the Murderer 5and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act, for each 6applicant for employment, after July 1, 2007, to determine 7whether the applicant has been adjudicated of a sex offense or 8of a murder or other violent crime against youth. The checks of 9the Statewide Sex Offender Database and the Statewide Murderer 10and Violent Offender Against Youth Database must be conducted 11by the non-public school once for every 5 years that an 12applicant remains employed by the non-public school.13    Any information concerning the record of convictions 14obtained by a non-public school's president or principal under 15this Section is confidential and may be disseminated only to 16the governing body of the non-public school or any other 17person necessary to the decision of hiring the applicant for 18employment. A copy of the record of convictions obtained from 19the Illinois State Police shall be provided to the applicant 20for employment. Upon a check of the Statewide Sex Offender 21Database, the non-public school shall notify the applicant as 22to whether or not the applicant has been identified in the Sex 23Offender Database as a sex offender. Any information 24concerning the records of conviction obtained by the 25non-public school's president or principal under this Section 26for a substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one   HB2827 Engrossed- 28 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1non-public school, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time 2employment positions with more than one non-public school (as 3a reading specialist, special education teacher, or 4otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee 5seeking employment positions with more than one non-public 6school may be shared with another non-public school's 7principal or president to which the applicant seeks 8employment. Any unauthorized release of confidential 9information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal 10Identification Act.11    No non-public school may obtain recognition status that 12knowingly employs a person, hired after July 1, 2007, for whom 13an Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation 14fingerprint-based criminal history records check and a 15Statewide Sex Offender Database check has not been initiated 16or who has been convicted of any offense enumerated in Section 1721B-80 of this Code or any offense committed or attempted in 18any other state or against the laws of the United States that, 19if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 20punishable as one or more of those offenses. No non-public 21school may obtain recognition status under this Section that 22knowingly employs a person who has been found to be the 23perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor under 18 24years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the 25Juvenile Court Act of 1987.26    In order to obtain recognition status under this Section,   HB2827 Engrossed- 29 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1a non-public school must require compliance with the 2provisions of this subsection (c-5) from all employees of 3persons or firms holding contracts with the school, including, 4but not limited to, food service workers, school bus drivers, 5and other transportation employees, who have direct, daily 6contact with pupils. Any information concerning the records of 7conviction or identification as a sex offender of any such 8employee obtained by the non-public school principal or 9president must be promptly reported to the school's governing 10body. 11    Prior to the commencement of any student teaching 12experience or required internship (which is referred to as 13student teaching in this Section) in any non-public elementary 14or secondary school that has obtained or seeks to obtain 15recognition status under this Section, a student teacher is 16required to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history 17records check. Authorization for and payment of the costs of 18the check must be furnished by the student teacher to the chief 19administrative officer of the non-public school where the 20student teaching is to be completed. Upon receipt of this 21authorization and payment, the chief administrative officer of 22the non-public school shall submit the student teacher's name, 23sex, race, date of birth, social security number, fingerprint 24images, and other identifiers, as prescribed by the Illinois 25State Police, to the Illinois State Police. The Illinois State 26Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall furnish,   HB2827 Engrossed- 30 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1pursuant to a fingerprint-based criminal history records 2check, records of convictions, forever and hereinafter, until 3expunged, to the chief administrative officer of the 4non-public school that requested the check. The Illinois State 5Police shall charge the school a fee for conducting the check, 6which fee must be passed on to the student teacher, must not 7exceed the cost of the inquiry, and must be deposited into the 8State Police Services Fund. The school shall further perform a 9check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, as authorized by 10the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, and of the 11Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth 12Database, as authorized by the Murderer and Violent Offender 13Against Youth Registration Act, for each student teacher. No 14school that has obtained or seeks to obtain recognition status 15under this Section may knowingly allow a person to student 16teach for whom a criminal history records check, a Statewide 17Sex Offender Database check, and a Statewide Murderer and 18Violent Offender Against Youth Database check have not been 19completed and reviewed by the chief administrative officer of 20the non-public school.21    A copy of the record of convictions obtained from the 22Illinois State Police must be provided to the student teacher. 23Any information concerning the record of convictions obtained 24by the chief administrative officer of the non-public school 25is confidential and may be transmitted only to the chief 26administrative officer of the non-public school or his or her   HB2827 Engrossed- 31 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1designee, the State Superintendent of Education, the State 2Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, or, for 3clarification purposes, the Illinois State Police or the 4Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and 5Violent Offender Against Youth Database. Any unauthorized 6release of confidential information may be a violation of 7Section 7 of the Criminal Identification Act.8    No school that has obtained or seeks to obtain recognition 9status under this Section may knowingly allow a person to 10student teach who has been convicted of any offense that would 11subject him or her to license suspension or revocation 12pursuant to Section 21B-80 of this Code or who has been found 13to be the perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor 14under 18 years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II 15of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. 16    Any school that has obtained or seeks to obtain 17recognition status under this Section may not prohibit 18hairstyles historically associated with race, ethnicity, or 19hair texture, including, but not limited to, protective 20hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists. 21    (d) Public purposes.

Full Text of HB2827 ILGA.GOV HB2827 - 104th General Assembly HB2827 EngrossedLRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1    AN ACT concerning education. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Homeschool Act. 6    Section 5. Application. Nothing in this Act applies to 7schools registered or recognized under Section 2-3.25 of the 8School Code.  9    Section 10. Findings. The General Assembly finds:10        (1) Homeschool is a viable alternative to public 11    education when engaged in good faith and for the benefit 12    of students.13        (2) Homeschool is currently the fastest growing form 14    of education in the United States, yet the true number of 15    homeschool students is unknown and will continue to be 16    unknown without notification.17        (3) Abusers in this State have taken advantage of a 18    lack of notification to remove vulnerable students from 19    the supervision of mandatory reporters under the false 20    pretense of homeschool.21        (4) When abusers take students out of school under the 22    false pretense of homeschool, it conflates legitimate   HB2827 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1    homeschool with abuse and threatens the rights of those 2    families who homeschool in good faith and for the benefit 3    of their students.4        (5) The State does not have an adequate system to 5    further investigate signs of abuse once the abuser claims 6    the removal of a vulnerable student from the supervision 7    of mandatory reporters was under the false pretense of 8    homeschool.9        (6) The State's lack of process to investigate signs 10    of abuse further delegitimizes homeschool as a viable 11    alternative to public school.12        (7) A notification process and investigation of 13    educational neglect only after there is reasonable cause 14    to believe a student is suffering from educational neglect 15    is the least restrictive way for the State to protect 16    vulnerable students removed from the presence of mandatory 17    reporters under the false pretense of homeschool. 18    Section 15.

Registration and recognition of non-public 10elementary and secondary schools. 11    (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds and declares (i) 12that the Constitution of the State of Illinois provides that a 13"fundamental goal of the People of the State is the 14educational development of all persons to the limits of their 15capacities" and (ii) that the educational development of every 16school student serves the public purposes of the State. In 17order to ensure that all Illinois students and teachers have 18the opportunity to enroll and work in State-approved 19educational institutions and programs, the State Board of 20Education shall provide for the voluntary registration and 21recognition of non-public elementary and secondary schools. 22    (b) Registration. All non-public elementary and secondary 23schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily register with 24the State Board of Education on an annual basis. However,   HB2827 Engrossed- 24 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1beginning on August 1, 2026, all non-public elementary and 2secondary schools in the State of Illinois shall register with 3the State Board of Education on an annual basis. Registration 4shall be completed in conformance with procedures prescribed 5by the State Board of Education. Information required for 6registration shall include assurances of compliance (i) with 7federal and State laws regarding health examination and 8immunization, attendance, length of term, and 9nondiscrimination, including assurances that the school will 10not prohibit hairstyles historically associated with race, 11ethnicity, or hair texture, including, but not limited to, 12protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists, and 13(ii) with applicable fire and health safety requirements, 14(iii) with the requirement that all individuals in the school 15assigned to a teaching or administrative position hold, at a 16minimum, a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, 17(iv) with the requirement to maintain in its own records a list 18of every attending student's name, date of birth, grade level, 19address of residence, and the name and address of residence of 20at least one parent or guardian of each attending student, and 21(v) to confirm or deny to a truancy officer whether a 22particular student is enrolled and attending during the course 23of a truancy investigation under Article 26 of this Code.24    (c) Recognition. All non-public elementary and secondary 25schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily seek the 26status of "Non-public School Recognition" from the State Board   HB2827 Engrossed- 25 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1of Education. This status may be obtained by compliance with 2administrative guidelines and review procedures as prescribed 3by the State Board of Education. The guidelines and procedures 4must recognize that some of the aims and the financial bases of 5non-public schools are different from public schools and will 6not be identical to those for public schools, nor will they be 7more burdensome. The guidelines and procedures must also 8recognize the diversity of non-public schools and shall not 9impinge upon the noneducational relationships between those 10schools and their clientele. 11    (c-5) Prohibition against recognition. A non-public 12elementary or secondary school may not obtain "Non-public 13School Recognition" status unless the school requires all 14certified and non-certified applicants for employment with the 15school, after July 1, 2007, to authorize a fingerprint-based 16criminal history records check as a condition of employment to 17determine if such applicants have been convicted of any of the 18enumerated criminal or drug offenses set forth in Section 1921B-80 of this Code or have been convicted, within 7 years of 20the application for employment, of any other felony under the 21laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in 22any other state or against the laws of the United States that, 23if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 24punishable as a felony under the laws of this State.25    Authorization for the check shall be furnished by the 26applicant to the school, except that if the applicant is a   HB2827 Engrossed- 26 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one 2non-public school, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time 3employment positions with more than one non-public school (as 4a reading specialist, special education teacher, or 5otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee 6seeking employment positions with more than one non-public 7school, then only one of the non-public schools employing the 8individual shall request the authorization. Upon receipt of 9this authorization, the non-public school shall submit the 10applicant's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security 11number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as 12prescribed by the Illinois State Police, to the Illinois State 13Police.14    The Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of 15Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based 16criminal history records check, records of convictions, 17forever and hereafter, until expunged, to the president or 18principal of the non-public school that requested the check. 19The Illinois State Police shall charge that school a fee for 20conducting such check, which fee must be deposited into the 21State Police Services Fund and must not exceed the cost of the 22inquiry. Subject to appropriations for these purposes, the 23State Superintendent of Education shall reimburse non-public 24schools for fees paid to obtain criminal history records 25checks under this Section.26    A non-public school may not obtain recognition status   HB2827 Engrossed- 27 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1unless the school also performs a check of the Statewide Sex 2Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community 3Notification Law, and the Statewide Murderer and Violent 4Offender Against Youth Database, as authorized by the Murderer 5and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act, for each 6applicant for employment, after July 1, 2007, to determine 7whether the applicant has been adjudicated of a sex offense or 8of a murder or other violent crime against youth. The checks of 9the Statewide Sex Offender Database and the Statewide Murderer 10and Violent Offender Against Youth Database must be conducted 11by the non-public school once for every 5 years that an 12applicant remains employed by the non-public school.13    Any information concerning the record of convictions 14obtained by a non-public school's president or principal under 15this Section is confidential and may be disseminated only to 16the governing body of the non-public school or any other 17person necessary to the decision of hiring the applicant for 18employment. A copy of the record of convictions obtained from 19the Illinois State Police shall be provided to the applicant 20for employment. Upon a check of the Statewide Sex Offender 21Database, the non-public school shall notify the applicant as 22to whether or not the applicant has been identified in the Sex 23Offender Database as a sex offender. Any information 24concerning the records of conviction obtained by the 25non-public school's president or principal under this Section 26for a substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one   HB2827 Engrossed- 28 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1non-public school, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time 2employment positions with more than one non-public school (as 3a reading specialist, special education teacher, or 4otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee 5seeking employment positions with more than one non-public 6school may be shared with another non-public school's 7principal or president to which the applicant seeks 8employment. Any unauthorized release of confidential 9information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal 10Identification Act.11    No non-public school may obtain recognition status that 12knowingly employs a person, hired after July 1, 2007, for whom 13an Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation 14fingerprint-based criminal history records check and a 15Statewide Sex Offender Database check has not been initiated 16or who has been convicted of any offense enumerated in Section 1721B-80 of this Code or any offense committed or attempted in 18any other state or against the laws of the United States that, 19if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 20punishable as one or more of those offenses. No non-public 21school may obtain recognition status under this Section that 22knowingly employs a person who has been found to be the 23perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor under 18 24years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the 25Juvenile Court Act of 1987.26    In order to obtain recognition status under this Section,   HB2827 Engrossed- 29 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1a non-public school must require compliance with the 2provisions of this subsection (c-5) from all employees of 3persons or firms holding contracts with the school, including, 4but not limited to, food service workers, school bus drivers, 5and other transportation employees, who have direct, daily 6contact with pupils. Any information concerning the records of 7conviction or identification as a sex offender of any such 8employee obtained by the non-public school principal or 9president must be promptly reported to the school's governing 10body. 11    Prior to the commencement of any student teaching 12experience or required internship (which is referred to as 13student teaching in this Section) in any non-public elementary 14or secondary school that has obtained or seeks to obtain 15recognition status under this Section, a student teacher is 16required to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history 17records check. Authorization for and payment of the costs of 18the check must be furnished by the student teacher to the chief 19administrative officer of the non-public school where the 20student teaching is to be completed. Upon receipt of this 21authorization and payment, the chief administrative officer of 22the non-public school shall submit the student teacher's name, 23sex, race, date of birth, social security number, fingerprint 24images, and other identifiers, as prescribed by the Illinois 25State Police, to the Illinois State Police. The Illinois State 26Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall furnish,   HB2827 Engrossed- 30 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1pursuant to a fingerprint-based criminal history records 2check, records of convictions, forever and hereinafter, until 3expunged, to the chief administrative officer of the 4non-public school that requested the check. The Illinois State 5Police shall charge the school a fee for conducting the check, 6which fee must be passed on to the student teacher, must not 7exceed the cost of the inquiry, and must be deposited into the 8State Police Services Fund. The school shall further perform a 9check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, as authorized by 10the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, and of the 11Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth 12Database, as authorized by the Murderer and Violent Offender 13Against Youth Registration Act, for each student teacher. No 14school that has obtained or seeks to obtain recognition status 15under this Section may knowingly allow a person to student 16teach for whom a criminal history records check, a Statewide 17Sex Offender Database check, and a Statewide Murderer and 18Violent Offender Against Youth Database check have not been 19completed and reviewed by the chief administrative officer of 20the non-public school.21    A copy of the record of convictions obtained from the 22Illinois State Police must be provided to the student teacher. 23Any information concerning the record of convictions obtained 24by the chief administrative officer of the non-public school 25is confidential and may be transmitted only to the chief 26administrative officer of the non-public school or his or her   HB2827 Engrossed- 31 -LRB104 10155 LNS 20227 b1designee, the State Superintendent of Education, the State 2Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, or, for 3clarification purposes, the Illinois State Police or the 4Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and 5Violent Offender Against Youth Database. Any unauthorized 6release of confidential information may be a violation of 7Section 7 of the Criminal Identification Act.8    No school that has obtained or seeks to obtain recognition 9status under this Section may knowingly allow a person to 10student teach who has been convicted of any offense that would 11subject him or her to license suspension or revocation 12pursuant to Section 21B-80 of this Code or who has been found 13to be the perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor 14under 18 years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II 15of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. 16    Any school that has obtained or seeks to obtain 17recognition status under this Section may not prohibit 18hairstyles historically associated with race, ethnicity, or 19hair texture, including, but not limited to, protective 20hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists. 21    (d) Public purposes.
