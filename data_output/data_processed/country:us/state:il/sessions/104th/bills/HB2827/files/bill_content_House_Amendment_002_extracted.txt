Amend House Bill 2827, AS AMENDED, 3by replacing everything after the enacting clause with the 4following: 5    "Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 6Homeschool Act. 7    Section 5. Application. Nothing in this Act applies to 8schools registered or recognized under Section 2-3.25 of the 9School Code.  10    Section 10. Findings. The General Assembly finds:11        (1) Homeschool is a viable alternative to public 12    education when engaged in good faith and for the benefit 13    of students.14        (2) Homeschool is currently the fastest growing form 15    of education in the United States, yet the true number of   10400HB2827ham002- 2 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1    homeschool students is unknown and will continue to be 2    unknown without notification.3        (3) Abusers in this State have taken advantage of a 4    lack of notification to remove vulnerable students from 5    the supervision of mandatory reporters under the false 6    pretense of homeschool.7        (4) When abusers take students out of school under the 8    false pretense of homeschool, it conflates legitimate 9    homeschool with abuse and threatens the rights of those 10    families who homeschool in good faith and for the benefit 11    of their students.12        (5) The State does not have an adequate system to 13    further investigate signs of abuse once the abuser claims 14    the removal of a vulnerable student from the supervision 15    of mandatory reporters was under the false pretense of 16    homeschool.17        (6) The State's lack of process to investigate signs 18    of abuse further delegitimizes homeschool as a viable 19    alternative to public school.20        (7) A notification process and investigation of 21    educational neglect only after there is reasonable cause 22    to believe a student is suffering from educational neglect 23    is the least restrictive way for the State to protect 24    vulnerable students removed from the presence of mandatory 25    reporters under the false pretense of homeschool.   10400HB2827ham002- 3 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1    Section 15.

Registration and recognition of non-public 18elementary and secondary schools. 19    (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds and declares (i) 20that the Constitution of the State of Illinois provides that a 21"fundamental goal of the People of the State is the 22educational development of all persons to the limits of their 23capacities" and (ii) that the educational development of every 24school student serves the public purposes of the State. In   10400HB2827ham002- 24 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1order to ensure that all Illinois students and teachers have 2the opportunity to enroll and work in State-approved 3educational institutions and programs, the State Board of 4Education shall provide for the voluntary registration and 5recognition of non-public elementary and secondary schools. 6    (b) Registration. All non-public elementary and secondary 7schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily register with 8the State Board of Education on an annual basis. However, 9beginning on August 1, 2026, all non-public elementary and 10secondary schools in the State of Illinois shall register with 11the State Board of Education on an annual basis. Registration 12shall be completed in conformance with procedures prescribed 13by the State Board of Education. Information required for 14registration shall include assurances of compliance (i) with 15federal and State laws regarding health examination and 16immunization, attendance, length of term, and 17nondiscrimination, including assurances that the school will 18not prohibit hairstyles historically associated with race, 19ethnicity, or hair texture, including, but not limited to, 20protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists, and 21(ii) with applicable fire and health safety requirements, 22(iii) with the requirement that all individuals in the school 23assigned to a teaching or administrative position hold, at a 24minimum, a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, 25(iv) with the requirement to maintain in its own records a list 26of every attending student's name, date of birth, grade level,   10400HB2827ham002- 25 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1address of residence, and the name and address of residence of 2at least one parent or guardian of each attending student, and 3(v) to confirm or deny to a truancy officer whether a 4particular student is enrolled and attending during the course 5of a truancy investigation under Article 26 of this Code.6    (c) Recognition. All non-public elementary and secondary 7schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily seek the 8status of "Non-public School Recognition" from the State Board 9of Education. This status may be obtained by compliance with 10administrative guidelines and review procedures as prescribed 11by the State Board of Education. The guidelines and procedures 12must recognize that some of the aims and the financial bases of 13non-public schools are different from public schools and will 14not be identical to those for public schools, nor will they be 15more burdensome. The guidelines and procedures must also 16recognize the diversity of non-public schools and shall not 17impinge upon the noneducational relationships between those 18schools and their clientele. 19    (c-5) Prohibition against recognition. A non-public 20elementary or secondary school may not obtain "Non-public 21School Recognition" status unless the school requires all 22certified and non-certified applicants for employment with the 23school, after July 1, 2007, to authorize a fingerprint-based 24criminal history records check as a condition of employment to 25determine if such applicants have been convicted of any of the 26enumerated criminal or drug offenses set forth in Section   10400HB2827ham002- 26 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a121B-80 of this Code or have been convicted, within 7 years of 2the application for employment, of any other felony under the 3laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in 4any other state or against the laws of the United States that, 5if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 6punishable as a felony under the laws of this State.7    Authorization for the check shall be furnished by the 8applicant to the school, except that if the applicant is a 9substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one 10non-public school, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time 11employment positions with more than one non-public school (as 12a reading specialist, special education teacher, or 13otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee 14seeking employment positions with more than one non-public 15school, then only one of the non-public schools employing the 16individual shall request the authorization. Upon receipt of 17this authorization, the non-public school shall submit the 18applicant's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security 19number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as 20prescribed by the Illinois State Police, to the Illinois State 21Police.22    The Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of 23Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based 24criminal history records check, records of convictions, 25forever and hereafter, until expunged, to the president or 26principal of the non-public school that requested the check.   10400HB2827ham002- 27 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1The Illinois State Police shall charge that school a fee for 2conducting such check, which fee must be deposited into the 3State Police Services Fund and must not exceed the cost of the 4inquiry. Subject to appropriations for these purposes, the 5State Superintendent of Education shall reimburse non-public 6schools for fees paid to obtain criminal history records 7checks under this Section.8    A non-public school may not obtain recognition status 9unless the school also performs a check of the Statewide Sex 10Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community 11Notification Law, and the Statewide Murderer and Violent 12Offender Against Youth Database, as authorized by the Murderer 13and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act, for each 14applicant for employment, after July 1, 2007, to determine 15whether the applicant has been adjudicated of a sex offense or 16of a murder or other violent crime against youth. The checks of 17the Statewide Sex Offender Database and the Statewide Murderer 18and Violent Offender Against Youth Database must be conducted 19by the non-public school once for every 5 years that an 20applicant remains employed by the non-public school.21    Any information concerning the record of convictions 22obtained by a non-public school's president or principal under 23this Section is confidential and may be disseminated only to 24the governing body of the non-public school or any other 25person necessary to the decision of hiring the applicant for 26employment.

Any unauthorized release of confidential 17information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal 18Identification Act.19    No non-public school may obtain recognition status that 20knowingly employs a person, hired after July 1, 2007, for whom 21an Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation 22fingerprint-based criminal history records check and a 23Statewide Sex Offender Database check has not been initiated 24or who has been convicted of any offense enumerated in Section 2521B-80 of this Code or any offense committed or attempted in 26any other state or against the laws of the United States that,   10400HB2827ham002- 29 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 2punishable as one or more of those offenses. No non-public 3school may obtain recognition status under this Section that 4knowingly employs a person who has been found to be the 5perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor under 18 6years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the 7Juvenile Court Act of 1987.8    In order to obtain recognition status under this Section, 9a non-public school must require compliance with the 10provisions of this subsection (c-5) from all employees of 11persons or firms holding contracts with the school, including, 12but not limited to, food service workers, school bus drivers, 13and other transportation employees, who have direct, daily 14contact with pupils. Any information concerning the records of 15conviction or identification as a sex offender of any such 16employee obtained by the non-public school principal or 17president must be promptly reported to the school's governing 18body. 19    Prior to the commencement of any student teaching 20experience or required internship (which is referred to as 21student teaching in this Section) in any non-public elementary 22or secondary school that has obtained or seeks to obtain 23recognition status under this Section, a student teacher is 24required to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history 25records check. Authorization for and payment of the costs of 26the check must be furnished by the student teacher to the chief   10400HB2827ham002- 30 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1administrative officer of the non-public school where the 2student teaching is to be completed. Upon receipt of this 3authorization and payment, the chief administrative officer of 4the non-public school shall submit the student teacher's name, 5sex, race, date of birth, social security number, fingerprint 6images, and other identifiers, as prescribed by the Illinois 7State Police, to the Illinois State Police. The Illinois State 8Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall furnish, 9pursuant to a fingerprint-based criminal history records 10check, records of convictions, forever and hereinafter, until 11expunged, to the chief administrative officer of the 12non-public school that requested the check. The Illinois State 13Police shall charge the school a fee for conducting the check, 14which fee must be passed on to the student teacher, must not 15exceed the cost of the inquiry, and must be deposited into the 16State Police Services Fund. The school shall further perform a 17check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, as authorized by 18the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, and of the 19Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth 20Database, as authorized by the Murderer and Violent Offender 21Against Youth Registration Act, for each student teacher. No 22school that has obtained or seeks to obtain recognition status 23under this Section may knowingly allow a person to student 24teach for whom a criminal history records check, a Statewide 25Sex Offender Database check, and a Statewide Murderer and 26Violent Offender Against Youth Database check have not been   10400HB2827ham002- 31 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1completed and reviewed by the chief administrative officer of 2the non-public school.3    A copy of the record of convictions obtained from the 4Illinois State Police must be provided to the student teacher. 5Any information concerning the record of convictions obtained 6by the chief administrative officer of the non-public school 7is confidential and may be transmitted only to the chief 8administrative officer of the non-public school or his or her 9designee, the State Superintendent of Education, the State 10Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, or, for 11clarification purposes, the Illinois State Police or the 12Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and 13Violent Offender Against Youth Database.

Amend House Bill 2827, AS AMENDED, 3by replacing everything after the enacting clause with the 4following: 5    "Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 6Homeschool Act. 7    Section 5. Application. Nothing in this Act applies to 8schools registered or recognized under Section 2-3.25 of the 9School Code.  10    Section 10. Findings. The General Assembly finds:11        (1) Homeschool is a viable alternative to public 12    education when engaged in good faith and for the benefit 13    of students.14        (2) Homeschool is currently the fastest growing form 15    of education in the United States, yet the true number of   10400HB2827ham002- 2 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1    homeschool students is unknown and will continue to be 2    unknown without notification.3        (3) Abusers in this State have taken advantage of a 4    lack of notification to remove vulnerable students from 5    the supervision of mandatory reporters under the false 6    pretense of homeschool.7        (4) When abusers take students out of school under the 8    false pretense of homeschool, it conflates legitimate 9    homeschool with abuse and threatens the rights of those 10    families who homeschool in good faith and for the benefit 11    of their students.12        (5) The State does not have an adequate system to 13    further investigate signs of abuse once the abuser claims 14    the removal of a vulnerable student from the supervision 15    of mandatory reporters was under the false pretense of 16    homeschool.17        (6) The State's lack of process to investigate signs 18    of abuse further delegitimizes homeschool as a viable 19    alternative to public school.20        (7) A notification process and investigation of 21    educational neglect only after there is reasonable cause 22    to believe a student is suffering from educational neglect 23    is the least restrictive way for the State to protect 24    vulnerable students removed from the presence of mandatory 25    reporters under the false pretense of homeschool.   10400HB2827ham002- 3 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1    Section 15.

Registration and recognition of non-public 18elementary and secondary schools. 19    (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds and declares (i) 20that the Constitution of the State of Illinois provides that a 21"fundamental goal of the People of the State is the 22educational development of all persons to the limits of their 23capacities" and (ii) that the educational development of every 24school student serves the public purposes of the State. In   10400HB2827ham002- 24 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1order to ensure that all Illinois students and teachers have 2the opportunity to enroll and work in State-approved 3educational institutions and programs, the State Board of 4Education shall provide for the voluntary registration and 5recognition of non-public elementary and secondary schools. 6    (b) Registration. All non-public elementary and secondary 7schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily register with 8the State Board of Education on an annual basis. However, 9beginning on August 1, 2026, all non-public elementary and 10secondary schools in the State of Illinois shall register with 11the State Board of Education on an annual basis. Registration 12shall be completed in conformance with procedures prescribed 13by the State Board of Education. Information required for 14registration shall include assurances of compliance (i) with 15federal and State laws regarding health examination and 16immunization, attendance, length of term, and 17nondiscrimination, including assurances that the school will 18not prohibit hairstyles historically associated with race, 19ethnicity, or hair texture, including, but not limited to, 20protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists, and 21(ii) with applicable fire and health safety requirements, 22(iii) with the requirement that all individuals in the school 23assigned to a teaching or administrative position hold, at a 24minimum, a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, 25(iv) with the requirement to maintain in its own records a list 26of every attending student's name, date of birth, grade level,   10400HB2827ham002- 25 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1address of residence, and the name and address of residence of 2at least one parent or guardian of each attending student, and 3(v) to confirm or deny to a truancy officer whether a 4particular student is enrolled and attending during the course 5of a truancy investigation under Article 26 of this Code.6    (c) Recognition. All non-public elementary and secondary 7schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily seek the 8status of "Non-public School Recognition" from the State Board 9of Education. This status may be obtained by compliance with 10administrative guidelines and review procedures as prescribed 11by the State Board of Education. The guidelines and procedures 12must recognize that some of the aims and the financial bases of 13non-public schools are different from public schools and will 14not be identical to those for public schools, nor will they be 15more burdensome. The guidelines and procedures must also 16recognize the diversity of non-public schools and shall not 17impinge upon the noneducational relationships between those 18schools and their clientele. 19    (c-5) Prohibition against recognition. A non-public 20elementary or secondary school may not obtain "Non-public 21School Recognition" status unless the school requires all 22certified and non-certified applicants for employment with the 23school, after July 1, 2007, to authorize a fingerprint-based 24criminal history records check as a condition of employment to 25determine if such applicants have been convicted of any of the 26enumerated criminal or drug offenses set forth in Section   10400HB2827ham002- 26 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a121B-80 of this Code or have been convicted, within 7 years of 2the application for employment, of any other felony under the 3laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in 4any other state or against the laws of the United States that, 5if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 6punishable as a felony under the laws of this State.7    Authorization for the check shall be furnished by the 8applicant to the school, except that if the applicant is a 9substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one 10non-public school, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time 11employment positions with more than one non-public school (as 12a reading specialist, special education teacher, or 13otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee 14seeking employment positions with more than one non-public 15school, then only one of the non-public schools employing the 16individual shall request the authorization. Upon receipt of 17this authorization, the non-public school shall submit the 18applicant's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security 19number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as 20prescribed by the Illinois State Police, to the Illinois State 21Police.22    The Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of 23Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based 24criminal history records check, records of convictions, 25forever and hereafter, until expunged, to the president or 26principal of the non-public school that requested the check.   10400HB2827ham002- 27 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1The Illinois State Police shall charge that school a fee for 2conducting such check, which fee must be deposited into the 3State Police Services Fund and must not exceed the cost of the 4inquiry. Subject to appropriations for these purposes, the 5State Superintendent of Education shall reimburse non-public 6schools for fees paid to obtain criminal history records 7checks under this Section.8    A non-public school may not obtain recognition status 9unless the school also performs a check of the Statewide Sex 10Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community 11Notification Law, and the Statewide Murderer and Violent 12Offender Against Youth Database, as authorized by the Murderer 13and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act, for each 14applicant for employment, after July 1, 2007, to determine 15whether the applicant has been adjudicated of a sex offense or 16of a murder or other violent crime against youth. The checks of 17the Statewide Sex Offender Database and the Statewide Murderer 18and Violent Offender Against Youth Database must be conducted 19by the non-public school once for every 5 years that an 20applicant remains employed by the non-public school.21    Any information concerning the record of convictions 22obtained by a non-public school's president or principal under 23this Section is confidential and may be disseminated only to 24the governing body of the non-public school or any other 25person necessary to the decision of hiring the applicant for 26employment.

Any unauthorized release of confidential 17information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal 18Identification Act.19    No non-public school may obtain recognition status that 20knowingly employs a person, hired after July 1, 2007, for whom 21an Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation 22fingerprint-based criminal history records check and a 23Statewide Sex Offender Database check has not been initiated 24or who has been convicted of any offense enumerated in Section 2521B-80 of this Code or any offense committed or attempted in 26any other state or against the laws of the United States that,   10400HB2827ham002- 29 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 2punishable as one or more of those offenses. No non-public 3school may obtain recognition status under this Section that 4knowingly employs a person who has been found to be the 5perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor under 18 6years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the 7Juvenile Court Act of 1987.8    In order to obtain recognition status under this Section, 9a non-public school must require compliance with the 10provisions of this subsection (c-5) from all employees of 11persons or firms holding contracts with the school, including, 12but not limited to, food service workers, school bus drivers, 13and other transportation employees, who have direct, daily 14contact with pupils. Any information concerning the records of 15conviction or identification as a sex offender of any such 16employee obtained by the non-public school principal or 17president must be promptly reported to the school's governing 18body. 19    Prior to the commencement of any student teaching 20experience or required internship (which is referred to as 21student teaching in this Section) in any non-public elementary 22or secondary school that has obtained or seeks to obtain 23recognition status under this Section, a student teacher is 24required to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history 25records check. Authorization for and payment of the costs of 26the check must be furnished by the student teacher to the chief   10400HB2827ham002- 30 -LRB104 10155 LNS 25154 a1administrative officer of the non-public school where the 2student teaching is to be completed.

The Illinois State 8Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall furnish, 9pursuant to a fingerprint-based criminal history records 10check, records of convictions, forever and hereinafter, until 11expunged, to the chief administrative officer of the 12non-public school that requested the check. The Illinois State 13Police shall charge the school a fee for conducting the check, 14which fee must be passed on to the student teacher, must not 15exceed the cost of the inquiry, and must be deposited into the 16State Police Services Fund. The school shall further perform a 17check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, as authorized by 18the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, and of the 19Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth 20Database, as authorized by the Murderer and Violent Offender 21Against Youth Registration Act, for each student teacher.
