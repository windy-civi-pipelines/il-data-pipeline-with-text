The School Code is amended by changing 19Sections 2-3.25o, 26-1, 26-3a, 26-7, and 26-16 as follows: 20    (105 ILCS 5/2-3.25o)21    Sec. 2-3.25o. Registration and recognition of non-public 22elementary and secondary schools. 23    (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds and declares (i) 24that the Constitution of the State of Illinois provides that a   10400HB2827ham001- 24 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1"fundamental goal of the People of the State is the 2educational development of all persons to the limits of their 3capacities" and (ii) that the educational development of every 4school student serves the public purposes of the State. In 5order to ensure that all Illinois students and teachers have 6the opportunity to enroll and work in State-approved 7educational institutions and programs, the State Board of 8Education shall provide for the voluntary registration and 9recognition of non-public elementary and secondary schools. 10    (b) Registration. All non-public elementary and secondary 11schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily register with 12the State Board of Education on an annual basis. However, 13beginning on August 1, 2026, all non-public elementary and 14secondary schools in the State of Illinois shall register with 15the State Board of Education on an annual basis. Registration 16shall be completed in conformance with procedures prescribed 17by the State Board of Education. Information required for 18registration shall include assurances of compliance (i) with 19federal and State laws regarding health examination and 20immunization, attendance, length of term, and 21nondiscrimination, including assurances that the school will 22not prohibit hairstyles historically associated with race, 23ethnicity, or hair texture, including, but not limited to, 24protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists, and 25(ii) with applicable fire and health safety requirements, 26(iii) with the requirement that all individuals in the school   10400HB2827ham001- 25 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1assigned to a teaching or administrative position hold, at a 2minimum, a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, 3and (iv) with the requirement to maintain in its own records a 4list of every attending student's name, date of birth, grade 5level, and home address and the name and home address of at 6least one parent or guardian of each attending student. A 7non-public elementary or secondary school shall provide this 8information to the State Board of Education and the regional 9office of education or intermediate service center for the 10school district where the non-public school is located, if 11applicable, or to the school board if the non-public school is 12located in a school district organized under Article 34 of 13this Code, upon request. Any personally identifying 14information of a student, parent, or guardian that any school 15or school district sends to the State Board of Education is 16confidential and exempt from disclosure according to the 17Freedom of Information Act and the Illinois School Student 18Records Act.19    (c) Recognition. All non-public elementary and secondary 20schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily seek the 21status of "Non-public School Recognition" from the State Board 22of Education. This status may be obtained by compliance with 23administrative guidelines and review procedures as prescribed 24by the State Board of Education. The guidelines and procedures 25must recognize that some of the aims and the financial bases of 26non-public schools are different from public schools and will   10400HB2827ham001- 26 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1not be identical to those for public schools, nor will they be 2more burdensome. The guidelines and procedures must also 3recognize the diversity of non-public schools and shall not 4impinge upon the noneducational relationships between those 5schools and their clientele. 6    (c-5) Prohibition against recognition. A non-public 7elementary or secondary school may not obtain "Non-public 8School Recognition" status unless the school requires all 9certified and non-certified applicants for employment with the 10school, after July 1, 2007, to authorize a fingerprint-based 11criminal history records check as a condition of employment to 12determine if such applicants have been convicted of any of the 13enumerated criminal or drug offenses set forth in Section 1421B-80 of this Code or have been convicted, within 7 years of 15the application for employment, of any other felony under the 16laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in 17any other state or against the laws of the United States that, 18if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 19punishable as a felony under the laws of this State.20    Authorization for the check shall be furnished by the 21applicant to the school, except that if the applicant is a 22substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one 23non-public school, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time 24employment positions with more than one non-public school (as 25a reading specialist, special education teacher, or 26otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee   10400HB2827ham001- 27 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1seeking employment positions with more than one non-public 2school, then only one of the non-public schools employing the 3individual shall request the authorization. Upon receipt of 4this authorization, the non-public school shall submit the 5applicant's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security 6number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as 7prescribed by the Illinois State Police, to the Illinois State 8Police.9    The Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of 10Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based 11criminal history records check, records of convictions, 12forever and hereafter, until expunged, to the president or 13principal of the non-public school that requested the check. 14The Illinois State Police shall charge that school a fee for 15conducting such check, which fee must be deposited into the 16State Police Services Fund and must not exceed the cost of the 17inquiry. Subject to appropriations for these purposes, the 18State Superintendent of Education shall reimburse non-public 19schools for fees paid to obtain criminal history records 20checks under this Section.21    A non-public school may not obtain recognition status 22unless the school also performs a check of the Statewide Sex 23Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community 24Notification Law, and the Statewide Murderer and Violent 25Offender Against Youth Database, as authorized by the Murderer 26and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act, for each   10400HB2827ham001- 28 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1applicant for employment, after July 1, 2007, to determine 2whether the applicant has been adjudicated of a sex offense or 3of a murder or other violent crime against youth. The checks of 4the Statewide Sex Offender Database and the Statewide Murderer 5and Violent Offender Against Youth Database must be conducted 6by the non-public school once for every 5 years that an 7applicant remains employed by the non-public school.8    Any information concerning the record of convictions 9obtained by a non-public school's president or principal under 10this Section is confidential and may be disseminated only to 11the governing body of the non-public school or any other 12person necessary to the decision of hiring the applicant for 13employment. A copy of the record of convictions obtained from 14the Illinois State Police shall be provided to the applicant 15for employment.

Any unauthorized release of confidential 4information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal 5Identification Act.6    No non-public school may obtain recognition status that 7knowingly employs a person, hired after July 1, 2007, for whom 8an Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation 9fingerprint-based criminal history records check and a 10Statewide Sex Offender Database check has not been initiated 11or who has been convicted of any offense enumerated in Section 1221B-80 of this Code or any offense committed or attempted in 13any other state or against the laws of the United States that, 14if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 15punishable as one or more of those offenses. No non-public 16school may obtain recognition status under this Section that 17knowingly employs a person who has been found to be the 18perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor under 18 19years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the 20Juvenile Court Act of 1987.21    In order to obtain recognition status under this Section, 22a non-public school must require compliance with the 23provisions of this subsection (c-5) from all employees of 24persons or firms holding contracts with the school, including, 25but not limited to, food service workers, school bus drivers, 26and other transportation employees, who have direct, daily   10400HB2827ham001- 30 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1contact with pupils. Any information concerning the records of 2conviction or identification as a sex offender of any such 3employee obtained by the non-public school principal or 4president must be promptly reported to the school's governing 5body. 6    Prior to the commencement of any student teaching 7experience or required internship (which is referred to as 8student teaching in this Section) in any non-public elementary 9or secondary school that has obtained or seeks to obtain 10recognition status under this Section, a student teacher is 11required to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history 12records check. Authorization for and payment of the costs of 13the check must be furnished by the student teacher to the chief 14administrative officer of the non-public school where the 15student teaching is to be completed. Upon receipt of this 16authorization and payment, the chief administrative officer of 17the non-public school shall submit the student teacher's name, 18sex, race, date of birth, social security number, fingerprint 19images, and other identifiers, as prescribed by the Illinois 20State Police, to the Illinois State Police. The Illinois State 21Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall furnish, 22pursuant to a fingerprint-based criminal history records 23check, records of convictions, forever and hereinafter, until 24expunged, to the chief administrative officer of the 25non-public school that requested the check. The Illinois State 26Police shall charge the school a fee for conducting the check,   10400HB2827ham001- 31 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1which fee must be passed on to the student teacher, must not 2exceed the cost of the inquiry, and must be deposited into the 3State Police Services Fund. The school shall further perform a 4check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, as authorized by 5the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, and of the 6Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth 7Database, as authorized by the Murderer and Violent Offender 8Against Youth Registration Act, for each student teacher.

Registration and recognition of non-public 22elementary and secondary schools. 23    (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds and declares (i) 24that the Constitution of the State of Illinois provides that a   10400HB2827ham001- 24 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1"fundamental goal of the People of the State is the 2educational development of all persons to the limits of their 3capacities" and (ii) that the educational development of every 4school student serves the public purposes of the State. In 5order to ensure that all Illinois students and teachers have 6the opportunity to enroll and work in State-approved 7educational institutions and programs, the State Board of 8Education shall provide for the voluntary registration and 9recognition of non-public elementary and secondary schools. 10    (b) Registration. All non-public elementary and secondary 11schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily register with 12the State Board of Education on an annual basis. However, 13beginning on August 1, 2026, all non-public elementary and 14secondary schools in the State of Illinois shall register with 15the State Board of Education on an annual basis. Registration 16shall be completed in conformance with procedures prescribed 17by the State Board of Education. Information required for 18registration shall include assurances of compliance (i) with 19federal and State laws regarding health examination and 20immunization, attendance, length of term, and 21nondiscrimination, including assurances that the school will 22not prohibit hairstyles historically associated with race, 23ethnicity, or hair texture, including, but not limited to, 24protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists, and 25(ii) with applicable fire and health safety requirements, 26(iii) with the requirement that all individuals in the school   10400HB2827ham001- 25 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1assigned to a teaching or administrative position hold, at a 2minimum, a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, 3and (iv) with the requirement to maintain in its own records a 4list of every attending student's name, date of birth, grade 5level, and home address and the name and home address of at 6least one parent or guardian of each attending student. A 7non-public elementary or secondary school shall provide this 8information to the State Board of Education and the regional 9office of education or intermediate service center for the 10school district where the non-public school is located, if 11applicable, or to the school board if the non-public school is 12located in a school district organized under Article 34 of 13this Code, upon request. Any personally identifying 14information of a student, parent, or guardian that any school 15or school district sends to the State Board of Education is 16confidential and exempt from disclosure according to the 17Freedom of Information Act and the Illinois School Student 18Records Act.19    (c) Recognition. All non-public elementary and secondary 20schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily seek the 21status of "Non-public School Recognition" from the State Board 22of Education. This status may be obtained by compliance with 23administrative guidelines and review procedures as prescribed 24by the State Board of Education. The guidelines and procedures 25must recognize that some of the aims and the financial bases of 26non-public schools are different from public schools and will   10400HB2827ham001- 26 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1not be identical to those for public schools, nor will they be 2more burdensome. The guidelines and procedures must also 3recognize the diversity of non-public schools and shall not 4impinge upon the noneducational relationships between those 5schools and their clientele. 6    (c-5) Prohibition against recognition. A non-public 7elementary or secondary school may not obtain "Non-public 8School Recognition" status unless the school requires all 9certified and non-certified applicants for employment with the 10school, after July 1, 2007, to authorize a fingerprint-based 11criminal history records check as a condition of employment to 12determine if such applicants have been convicted of any of the 13enumerated criminal or drug offenses set forth in Section 1421B-80 of this Code or have been convicted, within 7 years of 15the application for employment, of any other felony under the 16laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in 17any other state or against the laws of the United States that, 18if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 19punishable as a felony under the laws of this State.20    Authorization for the check shall be furnished by the 21applicant to the school, except that if the applicant is a 22substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one 23non-public school, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time 24employment positions with more than one non-public school (as 25a reading specialist, special education teacher, or 26otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee   10400HB2827ham001- 27 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1seeking employment positions with more than one non-public 2school, then only one of the non-public schools employing the 3individual shall request the authorization. Upon receipt of 4this authorization, the non-public school shall submit the 5applicant's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security 6number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as 7prescribed by the Illinois State Police, to the Illinois State 8Police.9    The Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of 10Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based 11criminal history records check, records of convictions, 12forever and hereafter, until expunged, to the president or 13principal of the non-public school that requested the check. 14The Illinois State Police shall charge that school a fee for 15conducting such check, which fee must be deposited into the 16State Police Services Fund and must not exceed the cost of the 17inquiry. Subject to appropriations for these purposes, the 18State Superintendent of Education shall reimburse non-public 19schools for fees paid to obtain criminal history records 20checks under this Section.21    A non-public school may not obtain recognition status 22unless the school also performs a check of the Statewide Sex 23Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community 24Notification Law, and the Statewide Murderer and Violent 25Offender Against Youth Database, as authorized by the Murderer 26and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act, for each   10400HB2827ham001- 28 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1applicant for employment, after July 1, 2007, to determine 2whether the applicant has been adjudicated of a sex offense or 3of a murder or other violent crime against youth. The checks of 4the Statewide Sex Offender Database and the Statewide Murderer 5and Violent Offender Against Youth Database must be conducted 6by the non-public school once for every 5 years that an 7applicant remains employed by the non-public school.8    Any information concerning the record of convictions 9obtained by a non-public school's president or principal under 10this Section is confidential and may be disseminated only to 11the governing body of the non-public school or any other 12person necessary to the decision of hiring the applicant for 13employment. A copy of the record of convictions obtained from 14the Illinois State Police shall be provided to the applicant 15for employment.

Any unauthorized release of confidential 4information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal 5Identification Act.6    No non-public school may obtain recognition status that 7knowingly employs a person, hired after July 1, 2007, for whom 8an Illinois State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation 9fingerprint-based criminal history records check and a 10Statewide Sex Offender Database check has not been initiated 11or who has been convicted of any offense enumerated in Section 1221B-80 of this Code or any offense committed or attempted in 13any other state or against the laws of the United States that, 14if committed or attempted in this State, would have been 15punishable as one or more of those offenses. No non-public 16school may obtain recognition status under this Section that 17knowingly employs a person who has been found to be the 18perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor under 18 19years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the 20Juvenile Court Act of 1987.21    In order to obtain recognition status under this Section, 22a non-public school must require compliance with the 23provisions of this subsection (c-5) from all employees of 24persons or firms holding contracts with the school, including, 25but not limited to, food service workers, school bus drivers, 26and other transportation employees, who have direct, daily   10400HB2827ham001- 30 -LRB104 10155 LNS 23397 a1contact with pupils. Any information concerning the records of 2conviction or identification as a sex offender of any such 3employee obtained by the non-public school principal or 4president must be promptly reported to the school's governing 5body. 6    Prior to the commencement of any student teaching 7experience or required internship (which is referred to as 8student teaching in this Section) in any non-public elementary 9or secondary school that has obtained or seeks to obtain 10recognition status under this Section, a student teacher is 11required to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history 12records check. Authorization for and payment of the costs of 13the check must be furnished by the student teacher to the chief 14administrative officer of the non-public school where the 15student teaching is to be completed.
