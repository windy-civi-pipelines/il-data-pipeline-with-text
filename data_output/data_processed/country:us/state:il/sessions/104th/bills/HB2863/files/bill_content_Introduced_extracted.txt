The total amount of all of the appraisers' fees to be 16included in the transaction and closing costs shall not exceed 17the greater of $15,000 or 5% of the appraised value of the 18water or sewer utility being acquired.

Any 22acquisition of a water or sewer utility that affects the 23cumulative base rates of the large public utility's existing 24ratepayers in the tariff group into which the water or sewer 25utility is to be combined by less than (1) 2.5% at the time of 26the acquisition for any single acquisition completed under   HB2863- 7 -LRB104 08243 AAS 18293 b1this Section or (2) 5% for all acquisitions completed under 2this Section before the Commission's final order in the next 3rate case shall not be deemed to violate Section 7-204 or any 4other provision of this Act.5    In the Commission's order that approves the large public 6utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 7Commission shall issue its decision establishing (1) the 8ratemaking rate base of the water or sewer utility; (2) the 9district or tariff group with which the water or sewer utility 10shall be combined for ratemaking purposes, if such combination 11has been proposed by the large public utility; and (3) the 12rates to be charged to customers in the water or sewer utility.13    (e) If the water or sewer utility being acquired is owned 14by the State or any political subdivision thereof, then the 15water or sewer utility must inform the public of the terms of 16its acquisition by the large public utility by (1) holding a 17public meeting prior to the acquisition and (2) mailing a 18notice to the public residing in the area that the water or 19sewer utility operates.

For a period of 5 years after the 2acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the Commission 3shall deny any proposed rate increase that exceeds the maximum 4estimated rate increase provided in the notice. causing to be 5published, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 6that the water or sewer utility operates, a notice setting 7forth the terms of its acquisition by the large public utility 8and options that shall be available to assist customers to pay 9their bills after the acquisition. 10    (f) The large public utility may recommend the district or 11tariff group of which the water or sewer utility shall, for 12ratemaking purposes, become a part after the acquisition, or 13may recommend a lesser rate for the water or sewer utility. If 14the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 15submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 16proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer 17utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or 18rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 19recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 20contrary to the public interest.21    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 22rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 23next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 24utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 25district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 26lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and   HB2863- 9 -LRB104 08243 AAS 18293 b1approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided, 2that, if the application of such rates of the large public 3utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 4using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 5total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 6utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 7the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 8the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 9reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 10results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 11or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 12sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 13latest median household income as reported by the United 14States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 15county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 16potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 17a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned. These 18rates shall not be deemed to violate this Act including, but 19not limited to, Section 9-101 and any other applicable 20Sections in Articles VIII and IX of this Act. The Commission 21shall issue its decision establishing the rates effective for 22the water or sewer utility immediately following an 23acquisition in its order approving the acquisition.24    (h) In the acquiring large public utility's next rate 25case, the water or sewer utility and the district or tariff 26group ordered by the Commission and their costs of service may   HB2863- 10 -LRB104 08243 AAS 18293 b1be combined under the same rate tariff. This rate tariff shall 2be based on allocation of costs of service of the acquired 3water or sewer utility and the large public utility's district 4or tariff group ordered by the Commission and utilizing a rate 5design that does not distinguish among customers on the basis 6of utility service source or type. This rate tariff shall not 7be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 8Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 9utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 10subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 11tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 12Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 13tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 14combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 15Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 16the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 17existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than 182.5%. 19    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 20public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 21cost for financing set at the large public utility's 22determined rate for allowance for funds used during 23construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 24gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 25was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 26has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until   HB2863- 11 -LRB104 08243 AAS 18293 b1the time the rates are implemented in the large public 2utility's next rate case.3    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 4utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 5for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 6was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 7has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 8the time the rates are implemented in the large public 9utility's next rate case.10    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 11public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 12acquisition of water or sewer utilities. Any petitions filed 13with the Commission related to the acquisitions described in 14this Section, including petitions seeking approvals or 15certificates required by this Act, shall be deemed approved 16unless the Commission issues its final order within 11 months 17after the date the large public utility filed its initial 18petition. This Section shall only apply to utilities providing 19water or sewer service and shall not be construed in any manner 20to apply to electric corporations, natural gas corporations, 21or any other utility subject to this Act.22    (k) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a party from 23declining to proceed with an acquisition or be deemed as 24establishing the final purchase price of an acquisition.25    (l) In the Commission's order that approves the large 26utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the   HB2863- 12 -LRB104 08243 AAS 18293 b1Commission shall address each aspect of the acquisition 2transaction for which approval is required under the Act. 3    (m) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 4a water or sewer utility acquired by a large public utility 5under this Section shall be a responsible bidder as described 6in Section 30-22 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The 7contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence of meeting 8the requirements to be a responsible bidder as described in 9Section 30-22 to the water or sewer utility. Any new water or 10sewer facility built as a result of the acquisition shall 11require the contractor to enter into a project labor 12agreement. The large public utility acquiring the water or 13sewer utility shall offer employee positions to qualified 14employees of the acquired water or sewer utility. 15    (n) This Section is repealed on June 1, 2028. 16(Source: P.A. 102-149, eff. 1-1-22.)
