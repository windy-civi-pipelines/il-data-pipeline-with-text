The total amount of all of the appraisers' fees to be 23included in the transaction and closing costs shall not exceed 24the greater of $15,000 or 5% of the appraised value of the 25water or sewer utility being acquired. This rate base 26treatment shall not be deemed to violate this Act, including,   10400HB2863sam001- 7 -LRB104 08243 AAS 26089 a1but not limited to, any Sections in Articles VIII and IX of 2this Act that might be affected by this Section. Any 3acquisition of a water or sewer utility that affects the 4cumulative base rates of the large public utility's existing 5ratepayers in the tariff group into which the water or sewer 6utility is to be combined by less than (1) 2.5% at the time of 7the acquisition for any single acquisition completed under 8this Section or (2) 5% for all acquisitions completed under 9this Section before the Commission's final order in the next 10rate case shall not be deemed to violate Section 7-204 or any 11other provision of this Act.12    In the Commission's order that approves the large public 13utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 14Commission shall issue its decision establishing (1) the 15ratemaking rate base of the water or sewer utility; (2) the 16district or tariff group with which the water or sewer utility 17shall be combined for ratemaking purposes, if such combination 18has been proposed by the large public utility; and (3) the 19rates to be charged to customers in the water or sewer utility.20    (e) If the water or sewer utility being acquired is owned 21by the State or any political subdivision thereof, then the 22water or sewer utility must inform the public of the terms of 23its acquisition by the large public utility by (1) holding a 24public meeting prior to the acquisition and (2) causing to be 25published, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 26that the water or sewer utility operates, information about   10400HB2863sam001- 8 -LRB104 08243 AAS 26089 a1the public meeting being held prior to the acquisition, a 2notice setting forth the terms of the water or sewer utility's 3its acquisition by the large public utility, and options that 4shall be available to assist customers to pay their bills 5after the acquisition.

The 12notice shall include (i) information about the public meeting 13being held prior to the acquisition, (ii) information on the 14public body that will make the decision regarding the sale of 15the water or sewer utility, and (iii) if available, an 16estimate of the capital investment needs of the water or sewer 17utility being acquired. 18    (f) The large public utility may recommend the district or 19tariff group of which the water or sewer utility shall, for 20ratemaking purposes, become a part after the acquisition, or 21may recommend a lesser rate for the water or sewer utility. If 22the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 23submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 24proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer 25utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or 26rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's   10400HB2863sam001- 9 -LRB104 08243 AAS 26089 a1recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 2contrary to the public interest.3    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 4rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 5next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 6utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 7district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 8lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 9approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided, 10that, if the application of such rates of the large public 11utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 12using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 13total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 14utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 15the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 16the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 17reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 18results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 19or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 20sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 21latest median household income as reported by the United 22States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 23county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 24potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 25a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned. These 26rates shall not be deemed to violate this Act including, but   10400HB2863sam001- 10 -LRB104 08243 AAS 26089 a1not limited to, Section 9-101 and any other applicable 2Sections in Articles VIII and IX of this Act. The Commission 3shall issue its decision establishing the rates effective for 4the water or sewer utility immediately following an 5acquisition in its order approving the acquisition.6    (h) In the acquiring large public utility's next rate 7case, the water or sewer utility and the district or tariff 8group ordered by the Commission and their costs of service may 9be combined under the same rate tariff. This rate tariff shall 10be based on allocation of costs of service of the acquired 11water or sewer utility and the large public utility's district 12or tariff group ordered by the Commission and utilizing a rate 13design that does not distinguish among customers on the basis 14of utility service source or type. This rate tariff shall not 15be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 16Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 17utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 18subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 19tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 20Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 21tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 22combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 23Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 24the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 25existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than 262.5%.   10400HB2863sam001- 11 -LRB104 08243 AAS 26089 a1    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 2public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 3cost for financing set at the large public utility's 4determined rate for allowance for funds used during 5construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 6gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 7was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 8has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 9the time the rates are implemented in the large public 10utility's next rate case.11    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 12utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 13for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 14was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 15has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 16the time the rates are implemented in the large public 17utility's next rate case.18    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 19public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 20acquisition of water or sewer utilities. Any petitions filed 21with the Commission related to the acquisitions described in 22this Section, including petitions seeking approvals or 23certificates required by this Act, shall be deemed approved 24unless the Commission issues its final order within 11 months 25after the date the large public utility filed its initial 26petition. This Section shall only apply to utilities providing   10400HB2863sam001- 12 -LRB104 08243 AAS 26089 a1water or sewer service and shall not be construed in any manner 2to apply to electric corporations, natural gas corporations, 3or any other utility subject to this Act.4    (k) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a party from 5declining to proceed with an acquisition or be deemed as 6establishing the final purchase price of an acquisition.7    (l) In the Commission's order that approves the large 8utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 9Commission shall address each aspect of the acquisition 10transaction for which approval is required under the Act. 11    (m) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 12a water or sewer utility acquired by a large public utility 13under this Section shall be a responsible bidder as described 14in Section 30-22 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The 15contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence of meeting 16the requirements to be a responsible bidder as described in 17Section 30-22 to the water or sewer utility. Any new water or 18sewer facility built as a result of the acquisition shall 19require the contractor to enter into a project labor 20agreement. The large public utility acquiring the water or 21sewer utility shall offer employee positions to qualified 22employees of the acquired water or sewer utility. 23    (n) This Section is repealed on June 1, 2028. 24(Source: P.A. 102-149, eff. 1-1-22.)".
