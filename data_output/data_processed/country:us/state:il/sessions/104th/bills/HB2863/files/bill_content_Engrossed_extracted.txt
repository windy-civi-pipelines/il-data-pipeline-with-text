The notice shall include (i) information about 6the public meeting being held prior to the acquisition, (ii) 7information on the public body that will make the decision 8regarding the sale of the water or sewer utility, and (iii) a 9comparison of the current rate being charged by the water or 10sewer utility being acquired, the rate that is expected to be 11charged immediately following the acquisition, and the effect 12on rates if the acquisition does not proceed.13    (f) The large public utility may recommend the district or 14tariff group of which the water or sewer utility shall, for 15ratemaking purposes, become a part after the acquisition, or 16may recommend a lesser rate for the water or sewer utility. If 17the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 18submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 19proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer 20utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or 21rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 22recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 23contrary to the public interest.24    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 25rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 26next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer   HB2863 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 08243 AAS 18293 b1utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 2district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 3lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 4approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided, 5that, if the application of such rates of the large public 6utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 7using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 8total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 9utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 10the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 11the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 12reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 13results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 14or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 15sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 16latest median household income as reported by the United 17States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 18county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 19potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 20a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned.

This rate tariff shall 5be based on allocation of costs of service of the acquired 6water or sewer utility and the large public utility's district 7or tariff group ordered by the Commission and utilizing a rate 8design that does not distinguish among customers on the basis 9of utility service source or type. This rate tariff shall not 10be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 11Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 12utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 13subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 14tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 15Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 16tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 17combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 18Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 19the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 20existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than 212.5%. 22    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 23public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 24cost for financing set at the large public utility's 25determined rate for allowance for funds used during 26construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax   HB2863 Engrossed- 11 -LRB104 08243 AAS 18293 b1gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 2was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 3has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 4the time the rates are implemented in the large public 5utility's next rate case.6    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 7utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 8for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 9was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 10has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 11the time the rates are implemented in the large public 12utility's next rate case.13    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 14public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 15acquisition of water or sewer utilities. Any petitions filed 16with the Commission related to the acquisitions described in 17this Section, including petitions seeking approvals or 18certificates required by this Act, shall be deemed approved 19unless the Commission issues its final order within 11 months 20after the date the large public utility filed its initial 21petition. This Section shall only apply to utilities providing 22water or sewer service and shall not be construed in any manner 23to apply to electric corporations, natural gas corporations, 24or any other utility subject to this Act.25    (k) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a party from 26declining to proceed with an acquisition or be deemed as   HB2863 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 08243 AAS 18293 b1establishing the final purchase price of an acquisition.2    (l) In the Commission's order that approves the large 3utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 4Commission shall address each aspect of the acquisition 5transaction for which approval is required under the Act. 6    (m) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 7a water or sewer utility acquired by a large public utility 8under this Section shall be a responsible bidder as described 9in Section 30-22 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The 10contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence of meeting 11the requirements to be a responsible bidder as described in 12Section 30-22 to the water or sewer utility. Any new water or 13sewer facility built as a result of the acquisition shall 14require the contractor to enter into a project labor 15agreement. The large public utility acquiring the water or 16sewer utility shall offer employee positions to qualified 17employees of the acquired water or sewer utility. 18    (n) This Section is repealed on June 1, 2028. 19(Source: P.A. 102-149, eff. 1-1-22.)
