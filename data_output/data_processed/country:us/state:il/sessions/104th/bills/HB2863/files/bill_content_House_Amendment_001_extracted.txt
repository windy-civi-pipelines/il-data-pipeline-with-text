The total amount of all of the appraisers' fees to be 23included in the transaction and closing costs shall not exceed 24the greater of $15,000 or 5% of the appraised value of the 25water or sewer utility being acquired.

The notice shall include (i) information about 13the public meeting being held prior to the acquisition, (ii) 14information on the public body that will make the decision 15regarding the sale of the water or sewer utility, and (iii) a 16comparison of the current rate being charged by the water or 17sewer utility being acquired and the rate that is expected to 18be charged immediately following the acquisition.19    (f) The large public utility may recommend the district or 20tariff group of which the water or sewer utility shall, for 21ratemaking purposes, become a part after the acquisition, or 22may recommend a lesser rate for the water or sewer utility. If 23the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 24submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 25proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer 26utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or   10400HB2863ham001- 9 -LRB104 08243 AAS 24795 a1rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 2recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 3contrary to the public interest.4    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 5rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 6next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 7utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 8district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 9lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 10approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided, 11that, if the application of such rates of the large public 12utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 13using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 14total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 15utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 16the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 17the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 18reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 19results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 20or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 21sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 22latest median household income as reported by the United 23States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 24county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 25potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 26a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned. These   10400HB2863ham001- 10 -LRB104 08243 AAS 24795 a1rates shall not be deemed to violate this Act including, but 2not limited to, Section 9-101 and any other applicable 3Sections in Articles VIII and IX of this Act. The Commission 4shall issue its decision establishing the rates effective for 5the water or sewer utility immediately following an 6acquisition in its order approving the acquisition.7    (h) In the acquiring large public utility's next rate 8case, the water or sewer utility and the district or tariff 9group ordered by the Commission and their costs of service may 10be combined under the same rate tariff. This rate tariff shall 11be based on allocation of costs of service of the acquired 12water or sewer utility and the large public utility's district 13or tariff group ordered by the Commission and utilizing a rate 14design that does not distinguish among customers on the basis 15of utility service source or type. This rate tariff shall not 16be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 17Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 18utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 19subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 20tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 21Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 22tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 23combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 24Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 25the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 26existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than   10400HB2863ham001- 11 -LRB104 08243 AAS 24795 a12.5%. 2    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 3public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 4cost for financing set at the large public utility's 5determined rate for allowance for funds used during 6construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 7gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 8was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 9has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 10the time the rates are implemented in the large public 11utility's next rate case.12    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 13utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 14for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 15was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 16has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 17the time the rates are implemented in the large public 18utility's next rate case.19    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 20public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 21acquisition of water or sewer utilities. Any petitions filed 22with the Commission related to the acquisitions described in 23this Section, including petitions seeking approvals or 24certificates required by this Act, shall be deemed approved 25unless the Commission issues its final order within 11 months 26after the date the large public utility filed its initial   10400HB2863ham001- 12 -LRB104 08243 AAS 24795 a1petition. This Section shall only apply to utilities providing 2water or sewer service and shall not be construed in any manner 3to apply to electric corporations, natural gas corporations, 4or any other utility subject to this Act.5    (k) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a party from 6declining to proceed with an acquisition or be deemed as 7establishing the final purchase price of an acquisition.8    (l) In the Commission's order that approves the large 9utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 10Commission shall address each aspect of the acquisition 11transaction for which approval is required under the Act. 12    (m) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 13a water or sewer utility acquired by a large public utility 14under this Section shall be a responsible bidder as described 15in Section 30-22 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The 16contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence of meeting 17the requirements to be a responsible bidder as described in 18Section 30-22 to the water or sewer utility. Any new water or 19sewer facility built as a result of the acquisition shall 20require the contractor to enter into a project labor 21agreement. The large public utility acquiring the water or 22sewer utility shall offer employee positions to qualified 23employees of the acquired water or sewer utility. 24    (n) This Section is repealed on June 1, 2028. 25(Source: P.A. 102-149, eff. 1-1-22.)".

The Commission's approved district or tariff group or   10400HB2863ham001- 9 -LRB104 08243 AAS 24795 a1rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 2recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 3contrary to the public interest.4    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 5rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 6next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 7utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 8district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 9lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 10approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided, 11that, if the application of such rates of the large public 12utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 13using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 14total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 15utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 16the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 17the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 18reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 19results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 20or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 21sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 22latest median household income as reported by the United 23States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 24county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 25potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 26a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned.

This rate tariff shall not 16be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 17Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 18utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 19subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 20tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 21Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 22tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 23combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 24Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 25the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 26existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than   10400HB2863ham001- 11 -LRB104 08243 AAS 24795 a12.5%. 2    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 3public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 4cost for financing set at the large public utility's 5determined rate for allowance for funds used during 6construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 7gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 8was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 9has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 10the time the rates are implemented in the large public 11utility's next rate case.12    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 13utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 14for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 15was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 16has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 17the time the rates are implemented in the large public 18utility's next rate case.19    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 20public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 21acquisition of water or sewer utilities.
