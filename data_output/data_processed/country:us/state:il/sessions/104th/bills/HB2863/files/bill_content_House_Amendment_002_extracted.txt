The total amount of all of the appraisers' fees to be 23included in the transaction and closing costs shall not exceed 24the greater of $15,000 or 5% of the appraised value of the 25water or sewer utility being acquired.

The notice shall include (i) information about 13the public meeting being held prior to the acquisition, (ii) 14information on the public body that will make the decision 15regarding the sale of the water or sewer utility, and (iii) a 16comparison of the current rate being charged by the water or 17sewer utility being acquired, the rate that is expected to be 18charged immediately following the acquisition, and the effect 19on rates if the acquisition does not proceed.20    (f) The large public utility may recommend the district or 21tariff group of which the water or sewer utility shall, for 22ratemaking purposes, become a part after the acquisition, or 23may recommend a lesser rate for the water or sewer utility. If 24the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 25submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 26proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer   10400HB2863ham002- 9 -LRB104 08243 AAS 25014 a1utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or 2rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 3recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 4contrary to the public interest.5    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 6rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 7next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 8utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 9district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 10lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 11approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided, 12that, if the application of such rates of the large public 13utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 14using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 15total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 16utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 17the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 18the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 19reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 20results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 21or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 22sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 23latest median household income as reported by the United 24States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 25county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 26potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained,   10400HB2863ham002- 10 -LRB104 08243 AAS 25014 a1a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned. These 2rates shall not be deemed to violate this Act including, but 3not limited to, Section 9-101 and any other applicable 4Sections in Articles VIII and IX of this Act. The Commission 5shall issue its decision establishing the rates effective for 6the water or sewer utility immediately following an 7acquisition in its order approving the acquisition.8    (h) In the acquiring large public utility's next rate 9case, the water or sewer utility and the district or tariff 10group ordered by the Commission and their costs of service may 11be combined under the same rate tariff. This rate tariff shall 12be based on allocation of costs of service of the acquired 13water or sewer utility and the large public utility's district 14or tariff group ordered by the Commission and utilizing a rate 15design that does not distinguish among customers on the basis 16of utility service source or type. This rate tariff shall not 17be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 18Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 19utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 20subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 21tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 22Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 23tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 24combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 25Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 26the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's   10400HB2863ham002- 11 -LRB104 08243 AAS 25014 a1existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than 22.5%. 3    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 4public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 5cost for financing set at the large public utility's 6determined rate for allowance for funds used during 7construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 8gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 9was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 10has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 11the time the rates are implemented in the large public 12utility's next rate case.13    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 14utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 15for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 16was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 17has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 18the time the rates are implemented in the large public 19utility's next rate case.20    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 21public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 22acquisition of water or sewer utilities. Any petitions filed 23with the Commission related to the acquisitions described in 24this Section, including petitions seeking approvals or 25certificates required by this Act, shall be deemed approved 26unless the Commission issues its final order within 11 months   10400HB2863ham002- 12 -LRB104 08243 AAS 25014 a1after the date the large public utility filed its initial 2petition. This Section shall only apply to utilities providing 3water or sewer service and shall not be construed in any manner 4to apply to electric corporations, natural gas corporations, 5or any other utility subject to this Act.6    (k) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a party from 7declining to proceed with an acquisition or be deemed as 8establishing the final purchase price of an acquisition.9    (l) In the Commission's order that approves the large 10utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 11Commission shall address each aspect of the acquisition 12transaction for which approval is required under the Act. 13    (m) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 14a water or sewer utility acquired by a large public utility 15under this Section shall be a responsible bidder as described 16in Section 30-22 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The 17contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence of meeting 18the requirements to be a responsible bidder as described in 19Section 30-22 to the water or sewer utility. Any new water or 20sewer facility built as a result of the acquisition shall 21require the contractor to enter into a project labor 22agreement. The large public utility acquiring the water or 23sewer utility shall offer employee positions to qualified 24employees of the acquired water or sewer utility. 25    (n) This Section is repealed on June 1, 2028. 26(Source: P.A. 102-149, eff. 1-1-22.)".
