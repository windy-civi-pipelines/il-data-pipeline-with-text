and 7    WHEREAS, Article IV Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution 8guarantees a republican form of government, meaning government 9of the people, by the people, and for the people, but the 10people of rural, small town and suburban downstate Illinois do 11not experience this and instead experience a grossly 12disproportionate lack of power; and 13    WHEREAS, This concentration of power in Illinois' largest 14urban area opened the door to extreme gerrymandering and 15further decreased the voice of downstate Illinoisans, and 16gerrymandering has enabled one county, with 40% of the state's 17population, to dominate the other 60%;

and   HJ0016- 4 -LRB104 12413 MST 22695 r1    WHEREAS, This lack of accountability has led to Illinois 2ranking among the worst of the states in financial health and 3debt, having the worst credit rating and ranking 50th in 4fiscal stability, while giving the people of Illinois one of 5the greatest collective state and local tax burdens of the 50 6states; and 7    WHEREAS, Amendment XIV of the U.S. Constitution guarantees 8equal protection under the law; and 9    WHEREAS, The City of Chicago is frequently treated as a 10separate region of the state and has often been exempted from 11major legislative initiatives the General Assembly enacts into 12law because of this fact;

and 16    WHEREAS, Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution of the 17United States provides in part: New States may be admitted by 18Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or 19erected within the Jurisdiction of any other state; nor any 20State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts   HJ0016- 6 -LRB104 12413 MST 22695 r1of States, without the consent of the Legislatures of the 2States concerned as well as of the Congress, and that five 3states in the Union have been formed by separating from other 4states, most recently West Virginia;
