For purposes of this subparagraph, 24        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be 25        determined as if the election provided by Section 26        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in   HB3310- 103 -LRB104 10872 HLH 20954 b1        effect for all such years;2            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 3        corporation or association, the taxable income of such 4        organization determined in accordance with the 5        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the 6        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 7        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 8        activities against income from nonpatronage 9        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or 10        association may make an election to follow its federal 11        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 12        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 13        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over 14        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 15        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment 16        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 17        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 18        the losses are incurred. The election shall be 19        effective for all taxable years with original returns 20        due on or after the date of the election. In addition, 21        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 22        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 23        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 24        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to 25        the date of the election. Once made, the election may 26        only be revoked upon approval of the Director. The   HB3310- 104 -LRB104 10872 HLH 20954 b1        Department shall adopt rules setting forth 2        requirements for documenting the elections and any 3        resulting Illinois net loss and the standards to be 4        used by the Director in evaluating requests to revoke 5        elections. Public Act 96-932 is declaratory of 6        existing law; 7            (G) Subchapter S corporations. In the case of: (i) 8        a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 9        effect an election for the taxable year under Section 10        1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxable income 11        of such corporation determined in accordance with 12        Section 1363(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, except 13        that taxable income shall take into account those 14        items which are required by Section 1363(b)(1) of the 15        Internal Revenue Code to be separately stated; and 16        (ii) a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 17        effect a federal election to opt out of the provisions 18        of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 and have 19        applied instead the prior federal Subchapter S rules 20        as in effect on July 1, 1982, the taxable income of 21        such corporation determined in accordance with the 22        federal Subchapter S rules as in effect on July 1, 23        1982; and24            (H) Partnerships. In the case of a partnership, 25        taxable income determined in accordance with Section 26        703 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that taxable   HB3310- 105 -LRB104 10872 HLH 20954 b1        income shall take into account those items which are 2        required by Section 703(a)(1) to be separately stated 3        but which would be taken into account by an individual 4        in calculating his taxable income.5        (3) Recapture of business expenses on disposition of 6    asset or business. Notwithstanding any other law to the 7    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 8    business has been classified as business income and in a 9    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then 10    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 11    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 12    related to that asset or business that generated the 13    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as 14    business income in the year of the disposition of the 15    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to 16    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 17    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 18    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment 19    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 20    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 21    preceding taxable years.  22    (f) Valuation limitation amount.23        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount 24    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and 25    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:  HB3310- 106 -LRB104 10872 HLH 20954 b1            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 2        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 3        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the 4        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of 5        which such gain was reported for the taxable year; 6        plus7            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 8        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of 9        capital gain) for all property in respect of which 10        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 11        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 12        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 13        of such gain included in the amount determined under 14        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).15        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.16            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 17        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 18        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 19        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 20        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 21        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 22        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 23        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 24        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in 25        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of 26        such property.  HB3310- 107 -LRB104 10872 HLH 20954 b1            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 2        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 3        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 4        amount for such property is that amount which bears 5        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of 6        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 7        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 8        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the 9        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of 10        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 11        period for the property.12            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 13        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the 14        purposes of this paragraph. 15    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 16otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 17to be deducted more than once. 18    (h) Legislative intention. Except as expressly provided by 19this Section there shall be no modifications or limitations on 20the amounts of income, gain, loss or deduction taken into 21account in determining gross income, adjusted gross income or 22taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the taxable 23year, or in the amount of such items entering into the 24computation of base income and net income under this Act for   HB3310- 108 -LRB104 10872 HLH 20954 b1such taxable year, whether in respect of property values as of 2August 1, 1969 or otherwise.3(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 4102-658, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-1112, eff. 512-21-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23; 103-478, eff. 1-1-24; 103-592, 6Article 10, Section 10-900, eff. 6-7-24; 103-592, Article 170, 7Section 170-90, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-647, 8eff. 7-1-24; revised 8-20-24.)

The addition modification required by this 15        subparagraph shall be reduced to the extent that 16        dividends were included in base income of the unitary 17        group for the same taxable year and received by the 18        taxpayer or by a member of the taxpayer's unitary 19        business group (including amounts included in gross 20        income under Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal 21        Revenue Code and amounts included in gross income 22        under Section 78 of the Internal Revenue Code) with 23        respect to the stock of the same person to whom the 24        intangible expenses and costs were directly or 25        indirectly paid, incurred, or accrued.
