Provides that the amendatory Act may be referred to as the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act. With regard to the retirement systems established under the General Assembly, State Employees, State Universities, Downstate Teachers, or Judges Article of the Code and the Illinois State Board of Investment, prohibits direct investment of any additional pension assets in the stocks, securities, or other obligations of any fossil fuel company or any subsidiary, affiliate, or parent of a fossil fuel company.

Requires pension system trustees to identify holdings that are invested in the stocks, securities, equities, fixed income, corporate bonds, prime commercial paper, or other obligations of fossil fuel companies.

Effective immediately.LRB104 12439 RPS 22758 b  A BILL FOR HB3961LRB104 12439 RPS 22758 b1    AN ACT concerning public employee benefits. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. This Act may be referred to as the Fossil Fuel 5Divestment Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that:7        (1) Climate change is a real and serious threat to the 8    health, welfare, and prosperity of all Illinoisans, now 9    and in the future. Scientific evidence indicates that 10    maintaining the status quo of fossil fuel energy 11    production will lead to catastrophic results.12        (2) Continued investment in the fossil fuel industry 13    is counterproductive to the goals set forth in the Energy 14    Transition Act. That Act, passed by the Illinois General 15    Assembly and signed into law in 2021, commits the State to 16    phasing out carbon emissions from the energy and transport 17    sectors and requires Illinois to be 100% reliant on 18    renewable energy by 2050.19        (3) The threats posed by climate change, and the 20    necessary transformation of the global energy system to 21    mitigate it, will have a serious negative impact on 22    investors whose assets are not aligned with the goal of 23    keeping the global average temperature increase below 1.5   HB3961- 2 -LRB104 12439 RPS 22758 b1    degrees Celsius.2        (4) Continued investment in fossil fuel-related 3    industries poses unacceptable risk to the long-term 4    sustainability of State and local pension funds that are 5    under the State Treasurer's control; to the long-term 6    sustainability of $26,000,000,000 of the State's 7    investments, $17,000,000,000 in the programs established 8    pursuant to Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, 9    $12,000,000,000 of the Illinois Funds, $80,000,000 of the 10    Secure Choice Retirement Savings Programs, and $30,000,000 11    in the ABLE Account Program; and to the sustainability of 12    other Illinois municipal and county funds.13        (5) Because the continued investment in fossil 14    fuel-related industries poses unacceptable risk to these 15    pension systems and State investments, those who hold 16    investment authority over these systems should divest from 17    fossil fuel companies and fossil fuel infrastructure. Such 18    entities are encouraged to invest in climate change 19    solutions where consistent with acceptable financial risk. 20    Section 10. The Illinois Pension Code is amended by adding 21Section 1-110.18 as follows: 22    (40 ILCS 5/1-110.18 new)23    Sec. 1-110.18.
