Such interim protective measures must not be 17    overly burdensome to the survivor or result in excluding 18    the survivor from participation in, denying the survivor 19    the benefits of, or subjecting the survivor to 20    discrimination under any education program or activity or 21    otherwise interfere with any right or privilege secured by 22    this Act or Title IX of the federal Education Amendments 23    of 1972.24        Interim and supportive measures may burden the 25    respondent, but must not be overly burdensome in that they 26    deny the respondent access to the respondent's education.   10400HB3689ham001- 20 -LRB104 08892 LNS 24803 a1    Nothing in this Section prohibits a higher education 2    institution from following its emergency removal process.3        The higher education institution shall bear the cost 4    of reasonable interim accommodations. The higher education 5    institution shall have a procedure for providing 6    reasonable interim protective measures and accommodations 7    to all students who report sexual violence, domestic 8    violence, dating violence, stalking, and sexual 9    harassment. Such measures and accommodations shall be 10    available even if a student does not file a formal 11    complaint, the student's complaint is dismissed, or there 12    is no finding of responsibility in the complaint 13    resolution procedure. These measures and accommodations 14    may include, but are not limited to, counseling; 15    extensions of deadlines and other course-related 16    adjustments; campus escort services; increased security 17    and monitoring of certain areas of the campus; campus no 18    contact orders and honoring protective orders entered by a 19    State civil or criminal court; leaves of absence to seek 20    medical care, legal assistance, counseling, safety 21    planning, or other assistance without penalty from the 22    higher education institution; excused absences to attend, 23    participate in, or prepare for a court proceeding; 24    training and education programs related to sexual 25    violence, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or 26    sexual harassment; and changes in a class, work, housing,   10400HB3689ham001- 21 -LRB104 08892 LNS 24803 a1    or an extracurricular or any other activity. A higher 2    education institution must make a good faith effort to 3    accommodate requests for interim protective measures and 4    accommodations. If the higher education institution cannot 5    grant a survivor's request and a comparable alternative is 6    not available, the higher education institution must 7    consider whether there are any other reasonably available 8    options that could support the survivor or meet the 9    survivor's needs and offer those options to the survivor. 10        (8) Any proceeding, meeting, or hearing held to 11    resolve complaints of alleged student violations of the 12    comprehensive policy shall protect the privacy of the 13    participating parties and witnesses. 14        (9) The complainant, regardless of this person's level 15    of involvement in the complaint resolution procedure, and 16    the respondent shall have the opportunity to provide or 17    present evidence and witnesses on their behalf during the 18    complaint resolution procedure. 19        (9.5) The higher education institution may not 20    distribute any evidence that includes a private or 21    intentionally digitally altered sexual image by physical 22    or electronic means, except as legally required by a 23    subpoena or court order or as requested by the 24    complainant. The complainant, the respondent, and each 25    party's advisor shall have the opportunity to view 26    physical or electronic copies of any private or   10400HB3689ham001- 22 -LRB104 08892 LNS 24803 a1    intentionally digitally altered sexual image evidence in 2    person in a higher education institution office and only 3    in the presence of an individual resolving the complaint. 4    If either party is unable to view this evidence in person, 5    that party and that party's advisor may view it 6    temporarily via an electronic procedure established by the 7    higher education institution that ensures confidentiality. 8    Each party and each party's advisor must not create 9    physical or electronic copies of private or intentionally 10    digitally altered sexual image evidence. All private or 11    intentionally digitally altered sexual image evidence must 12    be kept in the strictest of confidence by the higher 13    education institution and its employees during and after 14    the completion of the complaint resolution procedure, and 15    evidence shall be retained as required under the federal 16    Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. 17        (10) The complainant, and the respondent, and each 18    party's complaint resolution procedure advisor, may not 19    directly question the other party cross examine one 20    another, but may, at the discretion and direction of the 21    individual or individuals resolving the complaint, suggest 22    questions to be posed to the party by the individual or 23    individuals resolving the complaint and respond to the 24    other party. This prohibition does not apply to any 25    complaint resolution procedure that involves a complaint 26    that the higher education institution is obligated to   10400HB3689ham001- 23 -LRB104 08892 LNS 24803 a1    address under Title IX of the federal Education Amendments 2    of 1972 if, at the time of the complaint resolution 3    procedure, Title IX rules require cross examination by the 4    parties' advisors. 5        (11) Both parties may request and must be allowed to 6    have an advisor of their choice accompany them to any 7    meeting or proceeding related to an alleged violation of 8    the comprehensive policy, provided that the involvement of 9    the advisor does not result in undue delay of the meeting 10    or proceeding. The advisor must comply with any rules in 11    the higher education institution's complaint resolution 12    procedure regarding the advisor's role. If the advisor 13    violates the rules or engages in behavior or advocacy that 14    harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a witness, 15    or an individual resolving the complaint, that advisor may 16    be prohibited from further participation. An advisor 17    specific to the complaint resolution procedure is separate 18    from a confidential advisor. 19        (12) The complainant and the respondent may not be 20    compelled to testify, if the complaint resolution 21    procedure involves a hearing, in the presence of the other 22    party. If a party invokes this right, the higher education 23    institution shall provide a procedure by which each party 24    can, at a minimum, hear the other party's testimony. 25        (12.5) Survivors of sexual violence, domestic 26    violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual harassment   10400HB3689ham001- 24 -LRB104 08892 LNS 24803 a1    have a right to have a support person of their choosing at 2    any meeting or proceeding related to an alleged violation 3    of the comprehensive policy or under Title IX of the 4    federal Education Amendments of 1972. If a support person 5    violates the rules or engages in behavior that harasses, 6    abuses, or intimidates either party, a witness, or an 7    individual resolving the complaint, that support person 8    may be prohibited from further participation. Nothing in 9    this paragraph (12.5) prohibits a higher education 10    institution from allowing respondents to have their own 11    support person. 12        (13) The complainant and the respondent are entitled 13    to simultaneous, written notification of the results of 14    the complaint resolution procedure, including information 15    regarding appeal rights, within 7 days of a decision or 16    sooner if required by State or federal law. 17        (14) The complainant and the respondent shall, at a 18    minimum, have the right to timely appeal the complaint 19    resolution procedure's findings or imposed sanctions if 20    the party alleges (i) a procedural error occurred, (ii) 21    new information exists that would substantially change the 22    outcome of the finding, or (iii) the sanction is 23    disproportionate with the violation. The individual or 24    individuals reviewing the findings or imposed sanctions 25    shall not have participated previously in the complaint 26    resolution procedure and shall not have a conflict of   10400HB3689ham001- 25 -LRB104 08892 LNS 24803 a1    interest with either party. The complainant and the 2    respondent shall receive written notice of any appeal and 3    the allegations asserted within 7 days after being 4    submitted to the higher education institution and notice 5    of the appeal decision in writing within 7 days after the 6    conclusion of the review of findings or sanctions or 7    sooner if required by federal or State law. 8        (15) The higher education institution shall not 9    disclose the identity of the survivor or the respondent, 10    except as necessary to resolve the complaint or to 11    implement interim protective measures and accommodations 12    or when provided by State or federal law.13(Source: P.A. 99-426, eff. 8-21-15.) 14    (110 ILCS 155/30)15    Sec. 30.
