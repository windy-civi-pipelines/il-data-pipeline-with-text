Full Text of SB2090 ILGA.GOV SB2090 - 104th General Assembly 104TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY State of Illinois 2025 and 2026SB2090 Introduced 2/6/2025, by Sen. Erica Harriss SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Stop Abusive Website-Access to Litigation Act. Authorizes the Attorney General to file a civil action in a State court against a party, attorney, or law firm that initiated the litigation that alleges any website-access violation for a determination as to whether it is abusive litigation. Provides that in determining whether the litigation alleging a website-access violation constitutes abusive litigation, the trier of fact shall consider the totality of the circumstances to determine if the primary purpose of the litigation that alleges a website-access violation is obtaining a payment from a defendant because of the costs of defending the action in court. Creates criteria for the trier of act to determine if the litigation is abusive under the Act. Provides that if the trier of fact determines that the litigation qualifies as abusive litigation under the Act, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the defendant. Provides that the court may also award punitive damages not to exceed 3 times the amount of attorney's fees awarded by the court.LRB104 08505 JRC 18557 b  A BILL FOR SB2090LRB104 08505 JRC 18557 b1    AN ACT concerning civil law. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Abusive Website-Access to Litigation Act. 6    Section 5. Legislative findings and purpose. The purpose 7of this Act is to restrict abusive litigation while allowing 8for meritorious litigation. It is the policy of this State 9that people with disabilities must be ensured equal 10opportunities to full access to public accommodations, and 11that they are empowered to enforce the right to equal access 12through litigation, if necessary. Unfortunately, the General 13Assembly recognizes that in a small minority of cases, the use 14of litigation to assert the right to equal access is being 15abused for the primary purpose of obtaining an award of 16attorney's fees for the plaintiff instead of remedying the 17alleged access violation. This small minority of cases often 18involves an alleged lack of equal access to a public 19accommodation's internet site and are often filed in another 20state's court system against smaller Illinois businesses. In 21most cases, the litigation is filed without notifying the 22defendant of the alleged violation, without attempting to 23resolve the issue prelitigation, and without providing a   SB2090- 2 -LRB104 08505 JRC 18557 b1reasonable opportunity for the public accommodation to revise 2its website to remedy the alleged access violation. To address 3this issue, the State intends to provide a process to curb 4abusive litigation to mitigate the harms that abusive 5litigation perpetuates. The State does not intend that this 6process in any way is to be used to preclude a person with a 7disability from asserting a right in good faith to equal 8access to a public accommodation under the law either 9individually or through a class through litigation in a State 10court.  11    Section 10. Definitions. As used in this Act: 12    "Access violation" means any allegation that a public 13accommodation does not provide sufficient access under the 14federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or comparable 15State law.16    "Public accommodation" has the meaning given to that term 17in the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 18"Public accommodation" includes a website operated by a 19resident of this State. 20    "Resident" means any person residing in this State and any 21entity that has filed with the Secretary of State's office 22requirements to do business in this State. 23    Section 15. Procedure under this Act. 24    (a) The Attorney General is authorized, on behalf of a   SB2090- 3 -LRB104 08505 JRC 18557 b1resident or a class of residents, who have been sued as 2defendants alleging a website-access violation, to file a 3civil action in a State court against the party, attorney, or 4law firm that initiated the website-access violation 5litigation for a determination as to whether the litigation is 6abusive under this Act. 7    (b) In determining whether litigation that alleges any 8website-access violation constitutes abusive litigation, the 9trier of fact shall consider the totality of the circumstances 10to determine if the primary purpose of the litigation is for 11obtaining a payment from a defendant because of the expense of 12defending the action in court. For the purposes of making this 13determination, the trier of fact may assess the following 14factors and any other factors the trier of fact deems 15relevant: 16        (1) the number of substantially similar actions filed 17    by the same plaintiff, lawyer, or law firm or the history 18    of such plaintiff, lawyer, or law firm in bringing 19    frivolous litigation or other litigation declared by a 20    court to be abusive litigation in the past 10 years; 21        (2) the number of full-time employees employed by the 22    defendant and the resources available to the defendant to 23    engage in the litigation; 24        (3) the resources available to the defendant to 25    correct the alleged website-access violation; 26        (4) whether the jurisdiction or venue where the action   SB2090- 4 -LRB104 08505 JRC 18557 b1    is brought is a substantial obstacle to defending against 2    the litigation; 3        (5) whether the filing party or lawyer filing the 4    litigation is a resident of this State or is licensed to 5    practice law in this State; 6        (6) the nature of settlement discussions, the 7    reasonableness of settlement offers, and refusals to 8    settle. The settlement information may be used only as 9    provided by this Section and may not otherwise alter the 10    applicable rules of evidence; and 11        (7) whether any factors under State law exist in the 12    litigation and whether sanctions are appropriate. 13    (c) If the defendant in the litigation alleging a 14website-access violation in good faith attempts to cure the 15alleged violation within 30 days after being provided written 16notice or being served a complaint with sufficient detail to 17identify and correct the alleged violation, there is a 18rebuttable presumption that a later initiation or continuance 19of the litigation constitutes abusive litigation. There is no 20rebuttable presumption that such litigation is abusive if the 21alleged website-access violation is not corrected, as 22determined by the court, within 90 days after the defendant 23was provided notice as under this subsection of the alleged 24violation. The trier of fact may not determine whether such 25litigation is abusive litigation until after such 90-day 26period expires or the alleged violation is corrected, as   SB2090- 5 -LRB104 08505 JRC 18557 b1determined by the court, whichever occurs first. If the 2Attorney General determines in writing that the access 3violation litigation is not abusive, that determination is a 4rebuttable presumption that the litigation is not abusive. 5    (d) At the conclusion of the litigation alleging a 6website-access violation, if the court determines that the 7litigation is abusive, it may award to the defendant 8attorney's fees and costs as appropriate under the Code of 9Civil Procedure and Supreme Court Rules. The court may also 10award to the defendant punitive damages not to exceed 3 times 11the amount of attorney's fees awarded to the defendant.
